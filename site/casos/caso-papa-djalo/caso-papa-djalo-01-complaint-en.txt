================================================================================

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE _____ DIVISION - FEDERAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT
JUDICIAL SECTION OF CEARA
BENEFIT CLAIM: SOCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR DISABLED PERSONS
REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

PAPA SELO DJALO, Guinean national, single, Tax ID
222.222.22.00, residing at Rua Aracati, No. 233, Praia de
Iracema District, Fortaleza/CE, ZIP Code 600000000, respectfully appears before Your
Honor, through the FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE, to file:

CIVIL ACTION FOR SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT
FOR DISABLED PERSONS WITH REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

against the BRAZILIAN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION - INSS,
a federal agency, located at Rua Pedro Pereira, 383, Downtown Fortaleza-CE,
based on the following facts and legal grounds:

I - REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF COURT COSTS

Initially, plaintiff requests waiver of court costs
as an indigent person under Law 1.060/50, being
unable to bear the costs of litigation and pay attorney's fees without
compromising personal or family subsistence, which is why plaintiff has retained the Federal Public
Defender's Office to represent the case, and therefore the
prerogatives inherent to the representing institution must be observed, especially regarding
double counting of all deadlines and personal service to its members.

II - STATEMENT OF FACTS

1

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

Plaintiff suffers from end-stage chronic kidney failure,
receiving hemodialysis treatment at Santa Casa de
Misericordia Hospital since January 1, 2005, 3 (three) times per week, as documented in the attached records. Additionally,
plaintiff has systemic arterial hypertension.

Due to the aforementioned illness, plaintiff is unable
to perform any work activity, as certified in the medical report signed
by Dr. Ana Cleide Pinheiro (Medical License 5097), nephrologist at Casa de Misericordia Hospital.

The medical examination report, prepared by Dr. Ana Maria
Araujo de Albuquerque, INSS medical examiner, requested by the Federal Public
Defender's Office in Ceara to perform medical-expert functions at the office, certifies that
claimant suffers from end-stage chronic kidney failure requiring hemodialysis, and,
given the described symptoms and hemodialysis treatment, presents work
incapacity.

Furthermore, claimant lives alone, in a rented house, without
any income, as even housing is paid for by friends and relatives from
Guinea-Bissau, enabling continued treatment in Brazil, since there
is no hemodialysis equipment available in his country of origin.

For this reason, the Federal Police notified him to leave the
country in June 2005; however, he was not deported for humanitarian reasons, given
that he is undergoing continuous treatment for chronic kidney failure,
unable to work to maintain a dignified life.

The fact that claimant is a foreign national does not constitute an obstacle, as
the Federal Constitution, when addressing social assistance, states it shall be provided to those in
need, making no distinction between Brazilians and foreigners, being guided by
social vulnerability, as provided in Article 203 of the Federal Constitution.

Given the factual situation presented, claimant
filed an administrative request with INSS, seeking Social Assistance
for Disabled Persons, alleging, in summary, that he is unable to work and to perform
acts of independent living and that he meets the other legal requirements for obtaining
said benefit. Nevertheless, to date he has received no response from said agency
by mail.

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

Therefore, given the inaction of INSS, defendant herein, in
addressing Plaintiff's claim, he now seeks through judicial means to realize his
constitutionally guaranteed right.

III - LEGAL ARGUMENTS

The Federal Constitution, in Article 203, Section V,
provides for needy, elderly persons an assistance benefit in the amount of one
minimum wage per month, as follows:

"Article 203. Social assistance shall be provided to those
in need, regardless of contribution to
social security, and has as its objectives:
I to IV - (omitted);
V - the guarantee of a monthly benefit of one minimum
wage to disabled persons and to elderly persons
who prove they lack the means to provide for their
own maintenance or to have it provided by their
family, as the law may provide."

Also, Law No. 8,742/93, known as the Organic Law
of Social Assistance (LOAS), implementing the constitutional provision, governs the
granting of the constitutionally guaranteed benefit to destitute persons.
Indeed, Article 20 of said law provides:

"Article 20. The continuing benefit is the
guarantee of 1 (one) minimum wage monthly to disabled
persons and to elderly persons 70 (seventy)
years or older who prove they lack the means to
provide for their own maintenance or to have it provided
by their family.
Paragraph 1. For purposes of this article, family means
the group of persons listed in Article
16 of Law No. 8,213, of July 24, 1991, provided they
live under the same roof.
Paragraph 2. For purposes of granting this benefit, a disabled
person is one who is incapable of independent
living and of working.

3

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

Paragraph 3. A family is considered incapable of providing for the
maintenance of a disabled or elderly person when
its monthly per capita income is less than 1/4 (one
quarter) of the minimum wage."

Based on the foregoing, we request that Your Honor grant
the social assistance benefit (social assistance for disabled persons), pursuant to
Article 203, Section V of the 1988 Constitution and Article 20, Paragraph 3 of Law No. 8,742/93, since he
meets all legal requirements, namely, being unable to work and
to live independently and having per capita family income below 1/4 of the minimum wage,
so that PAPASELO's situation is not further harmed.

Furthermore, Brazilian case law has consolidated understanding
regarding the possibility of granting social assistance benefits to
foreigners, even if not naturalized, as is claimant's case, since
the Federal Constitution, in the heading of Article 5, proclaims equality between Brazilians
and foreigners residing in the country, guaranteeing the inviolability of the right to life,
liberty, equality, security, and property.

SOCIAL SECURITY. GRANT OF CONTINUING
ASSISTANCE BENEFIT (SOCIAL ASSISTANCE)
TO FOREIGNER RESIDING IN THE
COUNTRY. POSSIBILITY.
-The condition of being a foreigner does not prevent appellee from
receiving the continuing benefit, since, according
to Article 5 of the Federal Constitution, foreigners
residing in the country are guaranteed enjoyment of
individual rights and guarantees on equal terms
with nationals.
-Requirements for implementation of the
social assistance benefit are met. Demonstrated that
plaintiff is elderly or disabled, having no means to provide for
maintenance.
-Interlocutory appeal denied.

IV - REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

4

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

Law No. 8,952/94, amending Article 273 of the Civil Procedure Code,
opened to the judge the possibility of anticipating, in whole or in part, the effects of the
final judicial relief, at plaintiff's request, provided the
requirements established in said legal provision are met.

This is a satisfactory remedy whose purpose is
to immediately realize the very claim pursued, and not merely to guarantee the effectiveness
of the proceeding itself (characteristic of preliminary measures).

Reasons of extreme urgency in realizing the violated right
or threatened with harm, together with a pre-constituted body of evidence and the
plausibility of plaintiff's allegations, authorize the judge to provisionally anticipate
the effects of final judicial relief.

In the words of Humberto Theodoro Junior, "these are demands
of justice that require that the realization of the right cannot, in certain cases,
await the long and inevitable delay of the final judgment."

In the present case, evident is the fear of irreparable damage or
damage difficult to repair to plaintiff's right, since the social assistance benefit
sought addresses demands for guaranteeing his very subsistence, seriously
compromised by physical inability to provide for it properly by his own means
or by those who participate in his family unit, hence its alimentary character
and being, therefore, urgent.

The unequivocal proof, in turn, is embodied
in the medical reports accompanying the initial pleading, proving claimant's
disability.

For these reasons, claimant requests that the effects of
final judicial relief be anticipated in order to direct
INSS to immediately implement the continuing benefit guaranteed by Article
20 of Law No. 8,742/93, until further judicial determination, under penalty of daily fine,
pursuant to Article 273, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Procedure Code combined with Article 461, Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the same
Procedural Code.

V - REQUESTS

In view of the foregoing, plaintiff requests of Your
Honor:

5

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

a) the grant of waiver of court costs, being a
needy person under the law;
b) preliminary injunction, at the outset of litigation
and without hearing the opposing party, to direct INSS to
immediately implement the social assistance benefit, as
requested;
c) service of process upon the Brazilian Social Security Administration - INSS,
in the person of its legal representative, regarding the terms
of this action, to answer if desired, under penalty
of default and deemed admission;
d) judgment in favor of the initial claim for the purpose of
ordering INSS to GRANT claimant
the continuing benefit provided in
Article 20 of Law No. 8,742/93, with payment of
past due and future installments from the date of filing the
administrative request.

Plaintiff intends to prove the allegations by all means of proof
permitted by law, especially documentary, testimonial, and expert evidence, all of which
is hereby requested.

The amount in controversy is set at R$ 27,900.00 (twenty-seven thousand
nine hundred reais).

Respectfully submitted.

Fortaleza, March 16, 2009.
