HONORABLE APPELLATE PANEL OF FEDERAL SMALL CLAIMS COURTS



RESPONSE TO APPEAL



CASE NO.: 2009.81.00.507062-3
PLAINTIFF: MAMA SELO DJALO
DEFENDANT: BRAZILIAN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION - INSS



Distinguished Judges




MAMA SELO DJALO, duly identified in the above-captioned case, appears before Your Honor, through the FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE, by the undersigned representative and intern, to timely file RESPONSE TO APPEAL, as follows.

I - FACTUAL SUMMARY

Plaintiff filed suit seeking the social assistance benefit, pursuant to Article 20 of Law No. 8,742/93, having Chronic Kidney Failure, undergoing hemodialysis 03 (three) or 04 (four) times per week. However, treatment only relieves the disease and does not cure it, rendering plaintiff unable to work, an incapacity that has persisted since 2005, when the disease was diagnosed.

In judgment, the trial court recognized plaintiff's claim, ordering INSS to immediately grant the disability social assistance benefit in the monthly amount of 01 (one) minimum wage with benefit start date of November 17, 2008, anticipating the effects of the relief for this purpose, given that court-ordered examination found that plaintiff is unable to perform work activity due to Chronic Kidney Failure.



II - ON THE MERITS

II.A) PLAINTIFF'S RIGHT TO DISABILITY SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT

The Federal Constitution, in Article 203, Section V, provides for needy disabled persons an assistance benefit in the amount of one minimum wage per month, as follows:

"Article 203 - Social assistance shall be provided to those in need, regardless of contribution to social security, and has as its objectives:

I to IV - (omitted);

V - the guarantee of a monthly benefit of one minimum wage to disabled persons and to elderly persons who prove they lack the means to provide for their own maintenance or to have it provided by their family, as the law may provide."

Law No. 8,742/93, known as the Organic Law of Social Assistance (LOAS), implementing the constitutional provision, governs the granting of the constitutionally guaranteed benefit to destitute persons. Indeed, Article 20 of said law provides:

"Article 20. The continuing benefit is the guarantee of 1 (one) minimum wage monthly to disabled persons and to elderly persons 70 (seventy) years or older who prove they lack the means to provide for their own maintenance or to have it provided by their family.

Paragraph 1. For purposes of this article, family means the group of persons listed in Article 16 of Law No. 8,213 of July 24, 1991, provided they live under the same roof.

Paragraph 2. For purposes of granting this benefit, a disabled person is one who is incapable of independent living and of working.

Paragraph 3. A family is considered incapable of providing for the maintenance of a disabled or elderly person when its monthly per capita income is less than 1/4 (one quarter) of the minimum wage."



                                   The main argument used by the Brazilian Social Security Administration to deny the social assistance benefit is based on the fact that claimant has foreign nationality, considering that Article 7 of Decree No. 6,214/2007, current regulation of Law No. 8,742/93, conditions this grant on acquisition of Brazilian naturalization.

                                    However, the distinction established by the regulatory decree is illegal and unconstitutional.

                                 Indeed, the Federal Constitution, in Article 5, heading, guarantees equality of rights between Brazilians and foreigners regarding the inviolability of the right to life, liberty, equality, security, and property.

                        Now, social protection through the granting of social security and assistance benefits aims to protect the fundamental right to subsistence, being thus inextricably linked to the right to life and the inviolability of human dignity. Therefore, infra-constitutional legislation, including laws, regulations, and ordinances, cannot establish any distinction between Brazilians and foreigners regarding this fundamental right.

                                Social protection must reach everyone without distinction, in respect of the principle of equality and universality of coverage and care (Federal Constitution, Article 194, sole paragraph, item I).

                                   Thus, Article 203 of the Federal Constitution and Law No. 8,742/93 itself do not establish, regarding the granting of social assistance benefits, any form of distinction between Brazilians and foreigners.

                                        Brazilian case law has consolidated understanding regarding this possibility of granting social assistance benefits, as shown in this decision:

"CONSTITUTIONAL. SOCIAL SECURITY. SOCIAL ASSISTANCE. CONTINUING BENEFIT. ARTICLE 203, V, OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION. REQUIREMENTS MET. GRANT TO FOREIGNER. ARTICLE 20, PARAGRAPH 3, OF LAW NO. 8,742/93. ANNUAL BONUS NOT DUE. PERSONAL AND NON-CUMULATIVE BENEFIT. REVIEW."
1 - Plaintiff's foreign status does not preclude the right to receive the social assistance benefit sought herein, due to the constitutional principle of equality and universality governing Social Security. Precedent of this Court.
2 - Having met the age requirement (67 years) and demonstrated insufficient resources for self-maintenance or maintenance by family, the benefit must be granted, pursuant to Article 203, V, of the Federal Constitution, regulated by Law No. 8,742/93 and Decree No. 1,744/95.
3 - Article 20, Paragraph 3, of Law No. 8,742/93, by providing the limit of 1/4 of the minimum wage, established a presumption of destitution, not precluding proof of insufficient resources by other means of evidence.
4 - Annual bonus not due, as Article 201, Paragraph 6, of the Federal Constitution, which governs it, refers only to retirees and pensioners. Furthermore, social assistance does not derive from work performance nor does it replace it.
5 - Personal and non-cumulative benefit with any other from Social Security or different system, except medical assistance.
6 - Under Articles 21 of Law No. 8,742/93 and 37 of Decree No. 1,744/95, the benefit must be reviewed every 2 (two) years, to assess continuity of the conditions that gave rise to it.
 7 - Appeal denied.
(COURT - THIRD REGION, Type: CIVIL APPEAL-, Case: 2002.61.19.004613-0 State: MS Deciding Body: NINTH PANEL, Decision date: 08/08/05 Document: TRF300095807, Reporter JUDGE NELSON BERNARDES)

                               It should be emphasized that one can never lose sight of the fact that the objective of Law No. 8,742/93 is to ensure minimum guarantee of meeting the individual's basic needs, as a State duty, under its Article 1.

                                                  The guarantee of assistance to the destitute is among the social rights provided in our Constitution, since Article 6 provides that "education, health, work, housing, leisure, security, social security, protection of motherhood and childhood, assistance to the destitute, are social rights, as provided in this Constitution."

And as a dimension of fundamental human rights, the State must not only ensure but effectively implement these positive benefits, as a way to guarantee preservation of human dignity, the core foundation of the Federative Republic of Brazil (Federal Constitution, Article 1, III).

As taught by the master constitutionalist Jose Afonso da Silva (Positive Constitutional Law Course, Malheiros Publishers, 23rd edition, p. 285), social rights "are positive benefits provided by the State, directly or indirectly, stated in constitutional provisions, which enable better living conditions for the weakest, rights that tend to equalize unequal social situations."


II.B) ON THE START DATE OF THE DISABILITY SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT


            In its appeal brief, INSS argues that the trial judge, in granting the social assistance benefit, should have counted the benefit start date from the date of the court-ordered examination (10/13/2009) and not from the administrative application (11/17/2008).

                                      Another argument used by the federal social security agency is that a private medical certificate cannot allow retroaction of the Disability Onset Date to a period prior to the court-ordered examination.

                                    Now, the court-ordered examination itself attested that the condition/disability began in May 2005 (even before the administrative application). Therefore, claimant has long needed the social assistance benefit (and not from the expert report) to obtain a dignified life, as he lacks means to provide for his own sustenance.

                                     In view of this, the initial date of incapacity must be counted from the date of the application and not from the court-ordered examination, since claimant had a certificate from a physician affiliated with the Unified Health System (Dr. Ana Maria Araujo de Albuquerque employee number SIAPE 1363715) and another certificate from Dr. Ana Cleide Pinheiro, Medical License 5097, nephrologist at Santa Casa de Misericordia Hospital at the date of the application proving the existence of the disease, therefore, INSS's argument does not prevail.

                                  There is abundant case law on this subject:


"SOCIAL SECURITY - SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT - LAW NO. 8,742/93 - LACK OF STANDING OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT - DISABLED PERSON - REQUIREMENTS MET - START DATE." 1. Dismissed INSS's allegation in its answer that the Federal Government was not called to join the suit as necessary co-defendant, since the consolidated understanding in the Superior Court of Justice is that the Federal Government lacks standing to appear as defendant in cases seeking continuing benefit, as provided in Article 20 of Law No. 8,742/93. 2. Analyzing the record, it appears that proof of Plaintiff's disability was established, given the expert report concluding work incapacity (item 2), and that "The disease plaintiff has limits the functionality of the left coxofemoral joint (hip), mainly extension, abduction (opening), external rotation, partially flexion and internal rotation, causes disparity of lower limbs, with shortening of the left (...) Use of orthosis for equalization of lower limbs will not bring any change to hip functionality described above. Surgical procedure (total hip replacement) will result in equalization of lower limbs, improvement in joint functionality, but will not allow physical or work activities requiring sudden or strenuous movements" (item 7). 3. Regarding capacity for independent living under LOAS Paragraph 2, it relates to material self-support, as it is a provision aimed at social assistance, and in this case, Plaintiff cannot work and needs care for health stability. 4. Regarding inability of family support, the reason for administrative denial was solely non-proof of Plaintiff's incapacity (p. 09), from which one presumes administrative proof of meeting the family income requirement under Article 20, Paragraph 3 of LOAS. Moreover, although INSS mentioned non-compliance with this requirement in the answer, subsequently, at the Evidentiary Hearing at p. 48, the parties waived oral evidence, requesting medical examination. 5. Finally, regarding the part of the judgment that considered Plaintiff entitled to receive the benefit from the date of the administrative application, it also requires no change, as documents in the record allow concluding that Plaintiff was already affected by the incapacitating disability since the application, dated 02/24/2003. 6. Mandatory review denied.

"SOCIAL SECURITY - CONTINUING BENEFIT - ARTICLE 203 OF CONSTITUTION - LAW NO. 8,742/93, ARTICLE 20 - EXCLUSIVE STANDING OF INSS - DISABLED PERSON - PROOF OF LEGAL REQUIREMENTS - WORK AND INDEPENDENT LIVING INCAPACITY - OFFICIAL MEDICAL EXAMINATION - PER CAPITA INCOME - RIGHT TO BENEFIT - START DATE - COURT COSTS - FINE - NOT APPLICABLE." 1. In cases seeking continuing benefit under Articles 20 and 21 of Law No. 8,742/93 (LOAS), INSS has exclusive standing as defendant. Unnecessary to include Federal Government in suit as necessary co-defendant. 2. Legal requirements present for granting continuing benefit called social assistance for elderly (Article 203 of 1988 Constitution and Article 2, V, Law No. 8,742/93), as proven that claimant has physical disability rendering work incapacity, lacking means to provide for self-maintenance or have it provided by family. 3. Although the Supreme Court declared constitutionality of requirement of minimum per capita income of 1/4 of minimum wage (Direct Action 1232/Federal District), it should be considered as a parameter for assessing need, not preventing other factors from being used to prove lack of conditions for dignified survival, as the Superior Court has repeatedly decided. Precedents. 4. Benefit start date set from date of administrative application, per precedents of this Court and Superior Court. 5. Daily fine against government not applicable in case where delay and/or resistance of administrator in complying with court order is not verified. 6. Appeal and mandatory review partially granted.
