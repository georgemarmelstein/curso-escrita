APPEAL BRIEF




The foreigner has no right to the social assistance benefit because:

1) national economic development is insufficient to increase the range of social assistance beneficiaries (principle of Selectivity and Distributiveness);
2) Article 203, V of the 1988 Constitution is a provision of limited effectiveness pending legislation;
3) Law 8,742/93 only covers CITIZENS;
4) expenses to be covered by payment of social assistance benefits to foreigners in national territory have no funding source;
5) granting social assistance benefits to elderly and disabled foreigners may generate immigration of destitute persons from countries neighboring Brazil.

IN CASE OF UPHOLDING THE JUDGMENT, WE REQUEST THAT THE BENEFIT START DATE BE SET AS THE DATE OF THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION, SINCE AT THE DATE OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPLICATION, ACCORDING TO THE SOCIOECONOMIC SURVEY BY THE PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE, DOC. 5, PLAINTIFF HAD INCOME OF R$240.00.




HONORABLE APPELLATE PANEL,


FACTS AND LAW

		The judgment must be reversed, which ordered implementation of the social assistance benefit, for the reasons set forth below:
		Article 1 of Law 8,742/93 expressly provides that granting the social assistance benefit has as a prerequisite the condition of "CITIZEN":
Article 1. Social assistance, the citizen's right and State's duty, is a non-contributory Social Security Policy that provides basic minimums, carried out through an integrated set of public and social initiatives, to guarantee meeting basic needs.

		Implementing said provision, Article 7 of Decree 6,564/08, which amends the Continuing Benefit regulations, approved by Decree No. 6,214 of September 26, 2007, allows granting only to NATURALIZED foreigners:
"Article 7. The naturalized Brazilian, domiciled in Brazil, elderly or with disability, observing the criteria established in this Regulation, who does not receive any other benefit under Social Security or any other system, national or foreign, except for medical assistance and in case of receiving special indemnity pension, observing the provisions of item VI of article 4, is also a beneficiary of the Continuing Benefit."

		As the best doctrine teaches, citizenship presupposes effective enjoyment of individual, collective, social, and political rights, which are based on nationality.

		In a unanimous decision at the trial session on March 29, 2006, the distinguished Second Appellate Panel of the Federal Small Claims Courts of Porto Alegre decided that foreigners have no right to receive the social assistance benefit provided in Law 8,742/93:
II - OPINION
[...]
The controversy in this case is limited to the fact that plaintiff, being a foreigner, not naturalized, would not be entitled to the benefit. On this point, the trial judge decided based on Article 4 of Decree 1,744/95.
Notwithstanding divergent understanding, I believe that said Decree, by providing that elderly persons and disabled foreigners who are naturalized and domiciled in Brazil are also beneficiaries, provided they are not covered by the social security system of their country of origin, came not to clarify, but to confuse, when read together with Article 1 of Law 8,742/93, which imposes, as a prerequisite for the right to social assistance, as previously seen, the condition of being a Brazilian citizen.
The current notion of citizenship, as taught by Jose Roberto Fernandes Castilho, concerns the effective enjoyment of individual, collective, social, and political rights (or participation in political life), all based on nationality - the right to have rights (on the classification of fundamental rights, see Jose Afonso da Silva).
It is important to clarify from the outset that citizenship rights are not confused with human rights, although there is common ground between them. Dalmo Dallari, for example, in texts and lectures, makes clear this differentiation when analyzing, in depth, the issue of human rights in today's world. One can say, in short, that citizenship rights concern public subjective rights enshrined in a particular legal system, concrete and specific. Human rights - a much broader expression - refer to the human person as the source-value of all social values (Miguel Reale). Discussion of human rights (right to life, right not to be subjected to torture, right not to be enslaved, right to nationality, etc.) is thus placed on another plane of theoretical analysis. On the global, universal plane, from a natural law perspective, not positive and topical ("Citizenship: Outline of Evolution and Meaning of the Expression" - Jose Roberto Fernandes Castilho).
As can be seen, for the exercise of rights inherent to citizenship, it is essential to enjoy the status of national of the State that confers such rights.
Since plaintiff does not have such status, I hold that the principle of equality cannot be invoked in the concrete case to support her claim, and the fact of residing, as alleged, for more than 40 years in Brazil, does not have the power to change that situation. It happens that, for acquisition of Brazilian nationality, the foreigner must expressly manifest this desire and submit to a process with administrative characteristics, processed before the Ministry of Justice, and which has a final formality of jurisdictional character, consisting of delivery of the naturalization certificate by the competent federal judge (Article 109, X, Constitution). "Until such delivery occurs, the foreigner is not yet Brazilian, and may even be excluded from national territory" (Supreme Court, Plenary, HC 62,795-1-SP, Reporter Justice Rafael Mayer, unanimous, Official Gazette, March 22, 1985, p. 3,623).
Thus, since plaintiff does not meet the prerequisite of Brazilian citizenship, I hold that the appealed judgment must be upheld as rendered.
I declare the constitutional matter raised in the appeal preserved for review. I immediately exclude preservation of infra-constitutional provisions. Indeed, there is no interest in preserving infra-constitutional legislation, given that in Small Claims Courts, special appeals are not allowed. The Superior Court of Justice, in repeated and settled jurisprudence now consolidated in a summary, declared that: "Special appeals do not lie against decisions rendered by second-instance bodies of Small Claims Courts" (Summary 203).
In view of the foregoing, I deny the appeal filed by plaintiff and order payment of costs and attorney's fees, which I set at 10% of the amount in controversy, with execution suspended by force of Article 12 of Law 1,060/50, as beneficiary of free legal assistance.
(CIVIL APPEAL No. 2005.71.95.018268-2/RS REPORTER: Judge Alexandre Goncalves Lippel - APPELLANT: MARGARITA HAYDEE PEREZ PERAZA DE GOTEMBIEWSKI - ATTORNEY: PAULA MARINEZ DA SILVA DE OLIVEIRA - APPELLEE: BRAZILIAN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION - INSS).


ON THE START DATE OF THE DISABILITY SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT

The trial judge, in ordering INSS to grant the opposing party the social assistance benefit, did so effective from the date of the administrative application (11/17/2008), when the court-ordered examination, whose result served as the basis for rendering the judgment now challenged, was only performed on 10/13/09.

NOTE THAT A PRIVATE MEDICAL CERTIFICATE CANNOT ALLOW RETROACTION OF THE DISABILITY ONSET DATE TO A PERIOD PRIOR TO THE COURT-ORDERED EXAMINATION.

In turn, Superior Court of Justice case law, which can well be applied, mutatis mutandis, to the case at hand, is settled in the sense that, when the administrative application for disability retirement is denied, it is only due from the date of the expert report, to wit:

"SOCIAL SECURITY - SPECIAL APPEAL - DISABILITY RETIREMENT - BENEFIT START DATE - DATE OF EXPERT REPORT - When the administrative application is denied, the disability retirement benefit must be granted from the medical expert report that found work incapacity. - Appeal heard and granted. (Superior Court - Special Appeal 259795 - RS - 5th Panel - Reporter Justice Jorge Scartezzini - Official Gazette 10/16/2000 - p. 334)"

Indeed, this position was adopted by the national uniformization panel of federal small claims courts, to wit:

"The National Uniformization Panel of Federal Small Claims Courts yesterday (08/05) granted a uniformization request filed by the Brazilian Social Security Administration (INSS) in which the Agency argues that the decision of the Appellate Panel of the Federal Small Claims Courts of Mato Grosso do Sul diverges from the prevailing understanding of the Superior Court of Justice (Superior Court). The Superior Court's understanding, established in Special Appeal No. 354,401-MG, decided on 03/12/2002, with Justice Vicente Leal as reporter, is that, in case of granting disability retirement, the benefit becomes due, as a rule, from the date of the medical examination attesting to incapacity." (Superior Court News of 08/06/2003).

Indeed, the understandings cited above, although referring to disability retirement, should be adopted in cases of granting disability social assistance benefits.

In the present case, the benefit, if granted, which is admitted only for argument's sake, should have as start date the date of the last examination, i.e., the court-ordered examination, as the prevailing case law has been deciding, especially since the application date record shows, through the document attached as exhibit 5 (socioeconomic survey by the Public Defender's Office), that plaintiff had income of R$240.00.


APPELLANT'S REQUEST

In view of the foregoing, INSS hopes and requests that this Honorable Panel hear this appeal, to ultimately grant it, dismissing plaintiff's claim, or setting the benefit start date as the date of the court-ordered examination.

Respectfully submitted.
