FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE
TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE _____ DIVISION - FEDERAL SMALL CLAIMS COURT
JUDICIAL SECTION OF CEARA
BENEFIT CLAIM: SOCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR DISABLED PERSONS
REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

PAPA SELO DJALO, Guinean national, single, Tax ID
222.222.22.00, residing at Rua Aracati, No. 233, Praia de
Iracema District, Fortaleza/CE, ZIP Code 600000000, respectfully appears before Your
Honor, through the FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE, to file:

CIVIL ACTION FOR SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT
FOR DISABLED PERSONS WITH REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

against the BRAZILIAN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION - INSS,
a federal agency, located at Rua Pedro Pereira, 383, Downtown Fortaleza-CE,
based on the following facts and legal grounds:

I - REQUEST FOR WAIVER OF COURT COSTS

Initially, plaintiff requests waiver of court costs
as an indigent person under Law 1.060/50, being
unable to bear the costs of litigation and pay attorney's fees without
compromising personal or family subsistence, which is why plaintiff has retained the Federal Public
Defender's Office to represent the case, and therefore the
prerogatives inherent to the representing institution must be observed, especially regarding
double counting of all deadlines and personal service to its members.

II - STATEMENT OF FACTS

1

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

Plaintiff suffers from end-stage chronic kidney failure,
receiving hemodialysis treatment at Santa Casa de
Misericordia Hospital since January 1, 2005, 3 (three) times per week, as documented in the attached records. Additionally,
plaintiff has systemic arterial hypertension.

Due to the aforementioned illness, plaintiff is unable
to perform any work activity, as certified in the medical report signed
by Dr. Ana Cleide Pinheiro (Medical License 5097), nephrologist at Casa de Misericordia Hospital.

The medical examination report, prepared by Dr. Ana Maria
Araujo de Albuquerque, INSS medical examiner, requested by the Federal Public
Defender's Office in Ceara to perform medical-expert functions at the office, certifies that
claimant suffers from end-stage chronic kidney failure requiring hemodialysis, and,
given the described symptoms and hemodialysis treatment, presents work
incapacity.

Furthermore, claimant lives alone, in a rented house, without
any income, as even housing is paid for by friends and relatives from
Guinea-Bissau, enabling continued treatment in Brazil, since there
is no hemodialysis equipment available in his country of origin.

For this reason, the Federal Police notified him to leave the
country in June 2005; however, he was not deported for humanitarian reasons, given
that he is undergoing continuous treatment for chronic kidney failure,
unable to work to maintain a dignified life.

The fact that claimant is a foreign national does not constitute an obstacle, as
the Federal Constitution, when addressing social assistance, states it shall be provided to those in
need, making no distinction between Brazilians and foreigners, being guided by
social vulnerability, as provided in Article 203 of the Federal Constitution.

Given the factual situation presented, claimant
filed an administrative request with INSS, seeking Social Assistance
for Disabled Persons, alleging, in summary, that he is unable to work and to perform
acts of independent living and that he meets the other legal requirements for obtaining
said benefit. Nevertheless, to date he has received no response from said agency
by mail.

2

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

Therefore, given the inaction of INSS, defendant herein, in
addressing Plaintiff's claim, he now seeks through judicial means to realize his
constitutionally guaranteed right.

III - LEGAL ARGUMENTS

The Federal Constitution, in Article 203, Section V,
provides for needy, elderly persons an assistance benefit in the amount of one
minimum wage per month, as follows:

"Article 203. Social assistance shall be provided to those
in need, regardless of contribution to
social security, and has as its objectives:
I to IV - (omitted);
V - the guarantee of a monthly benefit of one minimum
wage to disabled persons and to elderly persons
who prove they lack the means to provide for their
own maintenance or to have it provided by their
family, as the law may provide."

Also, Law No. 8,742/93, known as the Organic Law
of Social Assistance (LOAS), implementing the constitutional provision, governs the
granting of the constitutionally guaranteed benefit to destitute persons.
Indeed, Article 20 of said law provides:

"Article 20. The continuing benefit is the
guarantee of 1 (one) minimum wage monthly to disabled
persons and to elderly persons 70 (seventy)
years or older who prove they lack the means to
provide for their own maintenance or to have it provided
by their family.
Paragraph 1. For purposes of this article, family means
the group of persons listed in Article
16 of Law No. 8,213, of July 24, 1991, provided they
live under the same roof.
Paragraph 2. For purposes of granting this benefit, a disabled
person is one who is incapable of independent
living and of working.

3

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

Paragraph 3. A family is considered incapable of providing for the
maintenance of a disabled or elderly person when
its monthly per capita income is less than 1/4 (one
quarter) of the minimum wage."

Based on the foregoing, we request that Your Honor grant
the social assistance benefit (social assistance for disabled persons), pursuant to
Article 203, Section V of the 1988 Constitution and Article 20, Paragraph 3 of Law No. 8,742/93, since he
meets all legal requirements, namely, being unable to work and
to live independently and having per capita family income below 1/4 of the minimum wage,
so that PAPASELO's situation is not further harmed.

Furthermore, Brazilian case law has consolidated understanding
regarding the possibility of granting social assistance benefits to
foreigners, even if not naturalized, as is claimant's case, since
the Federal Constitution, in the heading of Article 5, proclaims equality between Brazilians
and foreigners residing in the country, guaranteeing the inviolability of the right to life,
liberty, equality, security, and property.

SOCIAL SECURITY. GRANT OF CONTINUING
ASSISTANCE BENEFIT (SOCIAL ASSISTANCE)
TO FOREIGNER RESIDING IN THE
COUNTRY. POSSIBILITY.
-The condition of being a foreigner does not prevent appellee from
receiving the continuing benefit, since, according
to Article 5 of the Federal Constitution, foreigners
residing in the country are guaranteed enjoyment of
individual rights and guarantees on equal terms
with nationals.
-Requirements for implementation of the
social assistance benefit are met. Demonstrated that
plaintiff is elderly or disabled, having no means to provide for
maintenance.
-Interlocutory appeal denied.

INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL-299149 Case:

PANEL Date: 08/21/2006)

IV - REQUEST FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

4

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

Law No. 8,952/94, amending Article 273 of the Civil Procedure Code,
opened to the judge the possibility of anticipating, in whole or in part, the effects of the
final judicial relief, at plaintiff's request, provided the
requirements established in said legal provision are met.

This is a satisfactory remedy whose purpose is
to immediately realize the very claim pursued, and not merely to guarantee the effectiveness
of the proceeding itself (characteristic of preliminary measures).

Reasons of extreme urgency in realizing the violated right
or threatened with harm, together with a pre-constituted body of evidence and the
plausibility of plaintiff's allegations, authorize the judge to provisionally anticipate
the effects of final judicial relief.

In the words of Humberto Theodoro Junior, "these are demands
of justice that require that the realization of the right cannot, in certain cases,
await the long and inevitable delay of the final judgment."

In the present case, evident is the fear of irreparable damage or
damage difficult to repair to plaintiff's right, since the social assistance benefit
sought addresses demands for guaranteeing his very subsistence, seriously
compromised by physical inability to provide for it properly by his own means
or by those who participate in his family unit, hence its alimentary character
and being, therefore, urgent.

The unequivocal proof, in turn, is embodied
in the medical reports accompanying the initial pleading, proving claimant's
disability.

For these reasons, claimant requests that the effects of
final judicial relief be anticipated in order to direct
INSS to immediately implement the continuing benefit guaranteed by Article
20 of Law No. 8,742/93, until further judicial determination, under penalty of daily fine,
pursuant to Article 273, Paragraph 3 of the Civil Procedure Code combined with Article 461, Paragraphs 4 and 5 of the same
Procedural Code.

V - REQUESTS

In view of the foregoing, plaintiff requests of Your
Honor:

5

FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE

a) the grant of waiver of court costs, being a
needy person under the law;
b) preliminary injunction, at the outset of litigation
and without hearing the opposing party, to direct INSS to
immediately implement the social assistance benefit, as
requested;
c) service of process upon the Brazilian Social Security Administration - INSS,
in the person of its legal representative, regarding the terms
of this action, to answer if desired, under penalty
of default and deemed admission;
d) judgment in favor of the initial claim for the purpose of
ordering INSS to GRANT claimant
the continuing benefit provided in
Article 20 of Law No. 8,742/93, with payment of
past due and future installments from the date of filing the
administrative request.

Plaintiff intends to prove the allegations by all means of proof
permitted by law, especially documentary, testimonial, and expert evidence, all of which
is hereby requested.

The amount in controversy is set at R$ 27,900.00 (twenty-seven thousand
nine hundred reais).

Respectfully submitted.

DEFENDANT'S ANSWER
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE HONORABLE FEDERAL JUDGE IN THE STATE OF CEARA

The BRAZILIAN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION - INSS,
a Federal Agency under the Ministry of Social Security and
Social Assistance - MPAS, established by Law No. 8,029 of
April 12, 1990, through its Specialized Federal Attorney's Office, respectfully
appears before Your Honor, in the above-captioned case,
to present and request the following:

For INSS's best defense, it is essential to hold
a settlement hearing and, if necessary, an
evidentiary hearing and trial. Indeed, since plaintiff has requested
a SOCIAL ASSISTANCE benefit, the evidentiary hearing will enable
INSS, through examination of plaintiff and witnesses,
to more fully exercise its right of defense.

On the other hand, the continuing benefit
is only due to disabled persons or elderly persons aged
65 or older who prove they lack the means to provide for their own
maintenance or to have it provided by their family. For this
reason, analysis of the claim requires a social
assessment conducted by a social worker appointed by the Court, carried
out in the presence of INSS's technical assistant, in the same
manner as medical examinations are currently conducted.

Therefore, we immediately request that the motion
for court-ordered social assessment and settlement hearing
be granted, followed by evidentiary hearing and trial.

According to Article 9 of Law No. 10,259 of July 12,
2001, the public agency must be served for the settlement hearing
and such service must be made with at least
30 days' advance notice.

Based on said provision, it is understood that
INSS must be served to file an ANSWER (in case of
contesting the action and reaching settlement with plaintiff) and that this
must be presented at the time of the settlement hearing.

We emphasize, initially, that in the Federal Small Claims

Courts of Fortaleza, in observance of the principle of procedural
economy and aiming for expeditious proceedings, the settlement
and evidentiary hearings are combined. Thus, in cases requiring
evidentiary proceedings at hearing, immediately after personal
testimony and witness examination, INSS is asked about the
possibility of reaching a judicial settlement.

Analyzing the terms of said legal provision
(Article 9 of Law No. 10,259/2001) in light of the procedural practice
adopted in the Federal Small Claims Courts of Fortaleza, one must
conclude that INSS must be served for the settlement hearing
(which, in this case, is unified with the evidentiary hearing) and that
the answer should only be filed at the end of the
settlement/evidentiary hearing, if a judicial settlement
is not possible.

Requiring INSS to, at the outset of proceedings,
state whether settlement is possible or to file an
answer still in a "preliminary settlement phase"
would greatly prejudice the Social Security Agency's
actions and defense. We explain:

In actions seeking Social
Assistance, it is impossible to propose settlement or contest the action before
the court-ordered medical examination or even before the administrative social
assessment (which will be conducted by INSS social workers). Indeed, in disputes
involving proof of disabling disability and/or the destitution of plaintiff's
family, it is materially impossible to reach settlement before
presentation of a medical report by a court expert; a report on the
family's economic conditions prepared by an INSS social worker
or one appointed by the court; and personal testimony of the opposing
party, from which confession may also be extracted. That is:
the settlement hearing, in such cases, as occurs
in cases involving rural workers,
must be held and necessarily coincide with the
evidentiary hearing, being immediately preceded by it.
We understand this is how it should be in all divisions of the
Federal Small Claims Courts.

Only after the settlement hearing
(which in our case is unified with the evidentiary hearing), if
conditions for settlement are not met, will INSS have all necessary elements to
file its answer, attaching at that
time all available evidence (plaintiff's administrative
file, social assessment conducted, medical opinion from
its technical assistant, etc.).

Therefore, the thirty-day period initially offered by the

Judiciary for defendant, in said cases, to propose
settlement, is merely a formal measure conventionally adopted,
incapable of producing the intended result, namely enabling
self-resolution of the dispute at the beginning of
judicial proceedings.

And it is precisely because of its ineffectiveness that said
30-day period does not satisfy the requirement established in Article 9 of Law No.
10,259/01, according to which INSS-defendant is guaranteed exercise of
its duty to produce its defense, including presentation of
all documentation available for resolution of the judicial
matter (Article 11 of the same law) until the time of
the settlement hearing, which, as stated, will inevitably
coincide with the evidentiary hearing, immediately
following it, as procedural logic informing the
special procedure of Federal Small Claims Courts requires, already consolidated by court practice.

Therefore, seeking to improve INSS's
defense, INSS requests application of said Article 9 of
Law No. 10,259/2001 and that the deadline for
filing the answer be considered as the time of the
settlement/evidentiary hearing.

Finally, even if plaintiff is under
guardianship, due to state court recognition of
absolute incapacity, such circumstance creates only a
rebuttable presumption (since INSS was not a party in the
guardianship proceedings) that the ward is incapable of managing his/her
own person and administering his/her assets, which does not
necessarily mean permanent inability to
perform any and all work activity from which he/she could
derive resources essential to his/her maintenance and for independent
living.

Therefore, court-ordered medical examination is also required,
which must focus precisely on the
specific requirements provided in governing legislation, without which
the social assistance benefit sought in the initial
claim cannot legitimately be granted. INSS thus requests
scheduling of medical examination even in cases of plaintiff being under guardianship.

ON THE MERITS

Having addressed the arguments above, INSS argues that
foreigners have no right to social assistance benefits because:
1) national economic development is insufficient to increase the range of social assistance
beneficiaries (principle of Selectivity and Distributiveness);
2) Article 203, V of the 1988 Constitution is a provision of limited effectiveness pending legislation;
3) Law 8,742/93 only covers CITIZENS;
4) expenses to be covered by payment of social assistance benefits to foreigners
in national territory have no funding source;
5) granting social assistance benefits to elderly and disabled foreigners may generate
immigration of destitute persons from countries neighboring Brazil.

Article 1 of Law 8,742/93 expressly provides that granting the social assistance
benefit has as a prerequisite the condition of "CITIZEN":

Article 1. Social assistance, the citizen's right and State's duty, is a
non-contributory Social Security Policy that provides basic
minimums, carried out through an integrated set of public
and social initiatives, to guarantee meeting basic
needs.

Implementing said provision, Article 7 of Decree 6,564/08, which
amends the Continuing Benefit regulations, approved by Decree No. 6,214 of
September 26, 2007, allows granting only to NATURALIZED foreigners:

"Article 7. The naturalized Brazilian, domiciled in Brazil, elderly or with
disability, observing the criteria established in this Regulation, who
does not receive any other benefit under Social Security or
any other system, national or foreign, except for medical
assistance and in case of receiving special indemnity pension,
observing the provisions of item VI of article 4, is also
a beneficiary of the Continuing Benefit."

As the best doctrine teaches, citizenship presupposes effective enjoyment of
individual, collective, social, and political rights, which are based on nationality.

In a unanimous decision at the trial session on
March 29, 2006, the distinguished Second Appellate Panel of the Federal Small Claims Courts of Porto Alegre
decided that foreigners have no right to receive the social assistance benefit provided
in Law 8,742/93:

II - OPINION
[...]
The controversy in this case is limited to the fact
that plaintiff, being a foreigner, not
naturalized, would not be entitled to the benefit. On this point,

the trial judge decided based on Article 4
of Decree 1,744/95.
Notwithstanding divergent understanding, I believe that
said Decree, by providing that elderly persons and
disabled foreigners who are naturalized and domiciled in
Brazil are also beneficiaries, provided they are not covered by the social
security system of their country of origin, came not to
clarify, but to confuse, when read together
with Article 1 of Law 8,742/93, which imposes, as a
prerequisite for the right to social assistance,
as previously seen, the condition of being a Brazilian
citizen.
The current notion of citizenship, as taught by Jose
Roberto Fernandes Castilho, concerns the effective enjoyment
of individual, collective, social, and
political rights (or participation in political life), all
based on nationality - the right to have rights
(on the classification of fundamental rights, see Jose
Afonso da Silva).
It is important to clarify from the outset that citizenship rights
are not confused with human rights,
although there is common ground between them. Dalmo
Dallari, for example, in texts and lectures, makes clear
this differentiation when analyzing, in depth, the
issue of human rights in today's world.
One can say, in short, that citizenship rights
concern public subjective rights
enshrined in a particular legal system,
concrete and specific. Human rights -
a much broader expression - refer to
the human person as the source-value of all
social values (Miguel Reale). Discussion of
human rights (right to life, right not to be
subjected to torture, right not to be enslaved,
right to nationality, etc.) is thus placed on
another plane of theoretical analysis. On the global,
universal plane, from a natural law perspective, not
positive and topical ("Citizenship: Outline of Evolution and
Meaning of the Expression" - Jose Roberto Fernandes
Castilho).
As can be seen, for the exercise of rights
inherent to citizenship, it is essential to enjoy the
status of national of the State that confers such
rights.
Since plaintiff does not have such status, I hold that the
principle of equality cannot be invoked in the concrete case
to support her claim, and the fact of
residing, as alleged, for more than 40 years in

Brazil, does not have the power to change that situation. It happens
that, for acquisition of Brazilian nationality, the
foreigner must expressly manifest this
desire and submit to a process with
administrative characteristics, processed
before the Ministry of Justice, and which has a
final formality of jurisdictional character, consisting of
delivery of the naturalization certificate by the competent
federal judge (Article 109, X, Constitution). "Until such
delivery occurs, the foreigner is not yet
Brazilian, and may even be excluded from
national territory" (Supreme Court, Plenary, HC 62,795-1-SP, Reporter
Justice Rafael Mayer, unanimous, Official Gazette, March 22, 1985, p. 3,623).
Thus, since plaintiff does not meet the prerequisite
of Brazilian citizenship, I hold that the appealed
judgment must be upheld as rendered.
I declare the constitutional matter raised in the appeal
preserved for review. I immediately exclude preservation
of infra-constitutional provisions. Indeed, there is no interest in
preserving infra-constitutional legislation, given
that in Small Claims Courts, special appeals are not allowed. The Superior
Court of Justice, in repeated and settled
jurisprudence now consolidated in a summary,
declared that: "Special appeals do not lie against decisions
rendered by second-instance bodies of Small Claims
Courts" (Summary 203).
In view of the foregoing, I deny the appeal filed
by plaintiff and order payment of
costs and attorney's fees, which I set at
10% of the amount in controversy, with execution suspended
by force of Article 12 of Law 1,060/50, as
beneficiary of free legal assistance.

We thus request dismissal of the claims.

On the global, universal plane, from a natural law perspective, not positive and topical ("Citizenship: Outline of Evolution and Meaning of the Expression" - Jose Roberto Fernandes Castilho).
As can be seen, for the exercise of rights inherent to citizenship, it is essential to enjoy the status of national of the State that confers such rights.
Since plaintiff does not have such status, I hold that the principle of equality cannot be invoked in the concrete case to support her claim, and the fact of residing, as alleged, for more than 40 years in Brazil, does not have the power to change that situation. It happens that, for acquisition of Brazilian nationality, the foreigner must expressly manifest this desire and submit to a process with administrative characteristics, processed before the Ministry of Justice, and which has a final formality of jurisdictional character, consisting of delivery of the naturalization certificate by the competent federal judge (Article 109, X, Constitution). "Until such delivery occurs, the foreigner is not yet Brazilian, and may even be excluded from national territory" (Supreme Court, Plenary, HC 62,795-1-SP, Reporter Justice Rafael Mayer, unanimous, Official Gazette, March 22, 1985, p. 3,623).
Thus, since plaintiff does not meet the prerequisite of Brazilian citizenship, I hold that the appealed judgment must be upheld as rendered.
I declare the constitutional matter raised in the appeal preserved for review. I immediately exclude preservation of infra-constitutional provisions. Indeed, there is no interest in preserving infra-constitutional legislation, given that in Small Claims Courts, special appeals are not allowed. The Superior Court of Justice, in repeated and settled jurisprudence now consolidated in a summary, declared that: "Special appeals do not lie against decisions rendered by second-instance bodies of Small Claims Courts" (Summary 203).
In view of the foregoing, I deny the appeal filed by plaintiff and order payment of costs and attorney's fees, which I set at 10% of the amount in controversy, with execution suspended by force of Article 12 of Law 1,060/50, as beneficiary of free legal assistance.
(CIVIL APPEAL No. 2005.71.95.018268-2/RS REPORTER: Judge Alexandre Goncalves Lippel - APPELLANT: MARGARITA HAYDEE PEREZ PERAZA DE GOTEMBIEWSKI - ATTORNEY: PAULA MARINEZ DA SILVA DE OLIVEIRA - APPELLEE: BRAZILIAN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION - INSS).


ON THE START DATE OF THE DISABILITY SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT

The trial judge, in ordering INSS to grant the opposing party the social assistance benefit, did so effective from the date of the administrative application (11/17/2008), when the court-ordered examination, whose result served as the basis for rendering the judgment now challenged, was only performed on 10/13/09.

NOTE THAT A PRIVATE MEDICAL CERTIFICATE CANNOT ALLOW RETROACTION OF THE DISABILITY ONSET DATE TO A PERIOD PRIOR TO THE COURT-ORDERED EXAMINATION.

In turn, Superior Court of Justice case law, which can well be applied, mutatis mutandis, to the case at hand, is settled in the sense that, when the administrative application for disability retirement is denied, it is only due from the date of the expert report, to wit:

"SOCIAL SECURITY - SPECIAL APPEAL - DISABILITY RETIREMENT - BENEFIT START DATE - DATE OF EXPERT REPORT - When the administrative application is denied, the disability retirement benefit must be granted from the medical expert report that found work incapacity. - Appeal heard and granted. (Superior Court - Special Appeal 259795 - RS - 5th Panel - Reporter Justice Jorge Scartezzini - Official Gazette 10/16/2000 - p. 334)"

Indeed, this position was adopted by the national uniformization panel of federal small claims courts, to wit:

"The National Uniformization Panel of Federal Small Claims Courts yesterday (08/05) granted a uniformization request filed by the Brazilian Social Security Administration (INSS) in which the Agency argues that the decision of the Appellate Panel of the Federal Small Claims Courts of Mato Grosso do Sul diverges from the prevailing understanding of the Superior Court of Justice (Superior Court). The Superior Court's understanding, established in Special Appeal No. 354,401-MG, decided on 03/12/2002, with Justice Vicente Leal as reporter, is that, in case of granting disability retirement, the benefit becomes due, as a rule, from the date of the medical examination attesting to incapacity." (Superior Court News of 08/06/2003).

Indeed, the understandings cited above, although referring to disability retirement, should be adopted in cases of granting disability social assistance benefits.

In the present case, the benefit, if granted, which is admitted only for argument's sake, should have as start date the date of the last examination, i.e., the court-ordered examination, as the prevailing case law has been deciding, especially since the application date record shows, through the document attached as exhibit 5 (socioeconomic survey by the Public Defender's Office), that plaintiff had income of R$240.00.


APPELLANT'S REQUEST

In view of the foregoing, INSS hopes and requests that this Honorable Panel hear this appeal, to ultimately grant it, dismissing plaintiff's claim, or setting the benefit start date as the date of the court-ordered examination.

Respectfully submitted.

RESPONSE TO APPEAL



CASE NO.: 2009.81.00.507062-3
PLAINTIFF: MAMA SELO DJALO
DEFENDANT: BRAZILIAN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION - INSS



Distinguished Judges




MAMA SELO DJALO, duly identified in the above-captioned case, appears before Your Honor, through the FEDERAL PUBLIC DEFENDER'S OFFICE, by the undersigned representative and intern, to timely file RESPONSE TO APPEAL, as follows.

I - FACTUAL SUMMARY

Plaintiff filed suit seeking the social assistance benefit, pursuant to Article 20 of Law No. 8,742/93, having Chronic Kidney Failure, undergoing hemodialysis 03 (three) or 04 (four) times per week. However, treatment only relieves the disease and does not cure it, rendering plaintiff unable to work, an incapacity that has persisted since 2005, when the disease was diagnosed.

In judgment, the trial court recognized plaintiff's claim, ordering INSS to immediately grant the disability social assistance benefit in the monthly amount of 01 (one) minimum wage with benefit start date of November 17, 2008, anticipating the effects of the relief for this purpose, given that court-ordered examination found that plaintiff is unable to perform work activity due to Chronic Kidney Failure.



II - ON THE MERITS

II.A) PLAINTIFF'S RIGHT TO DISABILITY SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT

The Federal Constitution, in Article 203, Section V, provides for needy disabled persons an assistance benefit in the amount of one minimum wage per month, as follows:

"Article 203 - Social assistance shall be provided to those in need, regardless of contribution to social security, and has as its objectives:

I to IV - (omitted);

V - the guarantee of a monthly benefit of one minimum wage to disabled persons and to elderly persons who prove they lack the means to provide for their own maintenance or to have it provided by their family, as the law may provide."

Law No. 8,742/93, known as the Organic Law of Social Assistance (LOAS), implementing the constitutional provision, governs the granting of the constitutionally guaranteed benefit to destitute persons. Indeed, Article 20 of said law provides:

"Article 20. The continuing benefit is the guarantee of 1 (one) minimum wage monthly to disabled persons and to elderly persons 70 (seventy) years or older who prove they lack the means to provide for their own maintenance or to have it provided by their family.

Paragraph 1. For purposes of this article, family means the group of persons listed in Article 16 of Law No. 8,213 of July 24, 1991, provided they live under the same roof.

Paragraph 2. For purposes of granting this benefit, a disabled person is one who is incapable of independent living and of working.

Paragraph 3. A family is considered incapable of providing for the maintenance of a disabled or elderly person when its monthly per capita income is less than 1/4 (one quarter) of the minimum wage."



                                   The main argument used by the Brazilian Social Security Administration to deny the social assistance benefit is based on the fact that claimant has foreign nationality, considering that Article 7 of Decree No. 6,214/2007, current regulation of Law No. 8,742/93, conditions this grant on acquisition of Brazilian naturalization.

                                    However, the distinction established by the regulatory decree is illegal and unconstitutional.

                                 Indeed, the Federal Constitution, in Article 5, heading, guarantees equality of rights between Brazilians and foreigners regarding the inviolability of the right to life, liberty, equality, security, and property.

                        Now, social protection through the granting of social security and assistance benefits aims to protect the fundamental right to subsistence, being thus inextricably linked to the right to life and the inviolability of human dignity. Therefore, infra-constitutional legislation, including laws, regulations, and ordinances, cannot establish any distinction between Brazilians and foreigners regarding this fundamental right.

                                Social protection must reach everyone without distinction, in respect of the principle of equality and universality of coverage and care (Federal Constitution, Article 194, sole paragraph, item I).

                                   Thus, Article 203 of the Federal Constitution and Law No. 8,742/93 itself do not establish, regarding the granting of social assistance benefits, any form of distinction between Brazilians and foreigners.

                                        Brazilian case law has consolidated understanding regarding this possibility of granting social assistance benefits, as shown in this decision:

"CONSTITUTIONAL. SOCIAL SECURITY. SOCIAL ASSISTANCE. CONTINUING BENEFIT. ARTICLE 203, V, OF THE FEDERAL CONSTITUTION. REQUIREMENTS MET. GRANT TO FOREIGNER. ARTICLE 20, PARAGRAPH 3, OF LAW NO. 8,742/93. ANNUAL BONUS NOT DUE. PERSONAL AND NON-CUMULATIVE BENEFIT. REVIEW."
1 - Plaintiff's foreign status does not preclude the right to receive the social assistance benefit sought herein, due to the constitutional principle of equality and universality governing Social Security. Precedent of this Court.
2 - Having met the age requirement (67 years) and demonstrated insufficient resources for self-maintenance or maintenance by family, the benefit must be granted, pursuant to Article 203, V, of the Federal Constitution, regulated by Law No. 8,742/93 and Decree No. 1,744/95.
3 - Article 20, Paragraph 3, of Law No. 8,742/93, by providing the limit of 1/4 of the minimum wage, established a presumption of destitution, not precluding proof of insufficient resources by other means of evidence.
4 - Annual bonus not due, as Article 201, Paragraph 6, of the Federal Constitution, which governs it, refers only to retirees and pensioners. Furthermore, social assistance does not derive from work performance nor does it replace it.
5 - Personal and non-cumulative benefit with any other from Social Security or different system, except medical assistance.
6 - Under Articles 21 of Law No. 8,742/93 and 37 of Decree No. 1,744/95, the benefit must be reviewed every 2 (two) years, to assess continuity of the conditions that gave rise to it.
 7 - Appeal denied.
(COURT - THIRD REGION, Type: CIVIL APPEAL-, Case: 2002.61.19.004613-0 State: MS Deciding Body: NINTH PANEL, Decision date: 08/08/05 Document: TRF300095807, Reporter JUDGE NELSON BERNARDES)

                               It should be emphasized that one can never lose sight of the fact that the objective of Law No. 8,742/93 is to ensure minimum guarantee of meeting the individual's basic needs, as a State duty, under its Article 1.

                                                  The guarantee of assistance to the destitute is among the social rights provided in our Constitution, since Article 6 provides that "education, health, work, housing, leisure, security, social security, protection of motherhood and childhood, assistance to the destitute, are social rights, as provided in this Constitution."

And as a dimension of fundamental human rights, the State must not only ensure but effectively implement these positive benefits, as a way to guarantee preservation of human dignity, the core foundation of the Federative Republic of Brazil (Federal Constitution, Article 1, III).

As taught by the master constitutionalist Jose Afonso da Silva (Positive Constitutional Law Course, Malheiros Publishers, 23rd edition, p. 285), social rights "are positive benefits provided by the State, directly or indirectly, stated in constitutional provisions, which enable better living conditions for the weakest, rights that tend to equalize unequal social situations."


II.B) ON THE START DATE OF THE DISABILITY SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT


            In its appeal brief, INSS argues that the trial judge, in granting the social assistance benefit, should have counted the benefit start date from the date of the court-ordered examination (10/13/2009) and not from the administrative application (11/17/2008).

                                      Another argument used by the federal social security agency is that a private medical certificate cannot allow retroaction of the Disability Onset Date to a period prior to the court-ordered examination.

                                    Now, the court-ordered examination itself attested that the condition/disability began in May 2005 (even before the administrative application). Therefore, claimant has long needed the social assistance benefit (and not from the expert report) to obtain a dignified life, as he lacks means to provide for his own sustenance.

                                     In view of this, the initial date of incapacity must be counted from the date of the application and not from the court-ordered examination, since claimant had a certificate from a physician affiliated with the Unified Health System (Dr. Ana Maria Araujo de Albuquerque employee number SIAPE 1363715) and another certificate from Dr. Ana Cleide Pinheiro, Medical License 5097, nephrologist at Santa Casa de Misericordia Hospital at the date of the application proving the existence of the disease, therefore, INSS's argument does not prevail.

                                  There is abundant case law on this subject:


"SOCIAL SECURITY - SOCIAL ASSISTANCE BENEFIT - LAW NO. 8,742/93 - LACK OF STANDING OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT - DISABLED PERSON - REQUIREMENTS MET - START DATE." 1. Dismissed INSS's allegation in its answer that the Federal Government was not called to join the suit as necessary co-defendant, since the consolidated understanding in the Superior Court of Justice is that the Federal Government lacks standing to appear as defendant in cases seeking continuing benefit, as provided in Article 20 of Law No. 8,742/93. 2. Analyzing the record, it appears that proof of Plaintiff's disability was established, given the expert report concluding work incapacity (item 2), and that "The disease plaintiff has limits the functionality of the left coxofemoral joint (hip), mainly extension, abduction (opening), external rotation, partially flexion and internal rotation, causes disparity of lower limbs, with shortening of the left (...) Use of orthosis for equalization of lower limbs will not bring any change to hip functionality described above. Surgical procedure (total hip replacement) will result in equalization of lower limbs, improvement in joint functionality, but will not allow physical or work activities requiring sudden or strenuous movements" (item 7). 3. Regarding capacity for independent living under LOAS Paragraph 2, it relates to material self-support, as it is a provision aimed at social assistance, and in this case, Plaintiff cannot work and needs care for health stability. 4. Regarding inability of family support, the reason for administrative denial was solely non-proof of Plaintiff's incapacity (p. 09), from which one presumes administrative proof of meeting the family income requirement under Article 20, Paragraph 3 of LOAS. Moreover, although INSS mentioned non-compliance with this requirement in the answer, subsequently, at the Evidentiary Hearing at p. 48, the parties waived oral evidence, requesting medical examination. 5. Finally, regarding the part of the judgment that considered Plaintiff entitled to receive the benefit from the date of the administrative application, it also requires no change, as documents in the record allow concluding that Plaintiff was already affected by the incapacitating disability since the application, dated 02/24/2003. 6. Mandatory review denied.

In cases seeking continuing benefit under Articles 20 and 21 of Law No. 8,742/93 (LOAS), INSS has exclusive standing as defendant. Unnecessary to include Federal Government in suit as necessary co-defendant. 2. Legal requirements present for granting continuing benefit called social assistance for elderly (Article 203 of 1988 Constitution and Article 2, V, Law No. 8,742/93), as proven that claimant has physical disability rendering work incapacity, lacking means to provide for self-maintenance or have it provided by family. 3. Although the Supreme Court declared constitutionality of requirement of minimum per capita income of 1/4 of minimum wage (Direct Action 1232/Federal District), it should be considered as a parameter for assessing need, not preventing other factors from being used to prove lack of conditions for dignified survival, as the Superior Court has repeatedly decided. Precedents. 4. Benefit start date set from date of administrative application, per precedents of this Court and Superior Court. 5. Daily fine against government not applicable in case where delay and/or resistance of administrator in complying with court order is not verified. 6. Appeal and mandatory review partially granted.
