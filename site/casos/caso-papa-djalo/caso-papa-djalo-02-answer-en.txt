PAPA DJALO CASE - DEFENDANT'S ANSWER
================================================================================

TO THE HONORABLE FEDERAL JUDGE IN THE STATE OF CEARA

The BRAZILIAN SOCIAL SECURITY ADMINISTRATION - INSS,
a Federal Agency under the Ministry of Social Security and
Social Assistance - MPAS, established by Law No. 8,029 of
April 12, 1990, through its Specialized Federal Attorney's Office, respectfully
appears before Your Honor, in the above-captioned case,
to present and request the following:

For INSS's best defense, it is essential to hold
a settlement hearing and, if necessary, an
evidentiary hearing and trial. Indeed, since plaintiff has requested
a SOCIAL ASSISTANCE benefit, the evidentiary hearing will enable
INSS, through examination of plaintiff and witnesses,
to more fully exercise its right of defense.

On the other hand, the continuing benefit
is only due to disabled persons or elderly persons aged
65 or older who prove they lack the means to provide for their own
maintenance or to have it provided by their family. For this
reason, analysis of the claim requires a social
assessment conducted by a social worker appointed by the Court, carried
out in the presence of INSS's technical assistant, in the same
manner as medical examinations are currently conducted.

Therefore, we immediately request that the motion
for court-ordered social assessment and settlement hearing
be granted, followed by evidentiary hearing and trial.

According to Article 9 of Law No. 10,259 of July 12,
2001, the public agency must be served for the settlement hearing
and such service must be made with at least
30 days' advance notice.

Based on said provision, it is understood that
INSS must be served to file an ANSWER (in case of
contesting the action and reaching settlement with plaintiff) and that this
must be presented at the time of the settlement hearing.

We emphasize, initially, that in the Federal Small Claims

Courts of Fortaleza, in observance of the principle of procedural
economy and aiming for expeditious proceedings, the settlement
and evidentiary hearings are combined. Thus, in cases requiring
evidentiary proceedings at hearing, immediately after personal
testimony and witness examination, INSS is asked about the
possibility of reaching a judicial settlement.

Analyzing the terms of said legal provision
(Article 9 of Law No. 10,259/2001) in light of the procedural practice
adopted in the Federal Small Claims Courts of Fortaleza, one must
conclude that INSS must be served for the settlement hearing
(which, in this case, is unified with the evidentiary hearing) and that
the answer should only be filed at the end of the
settlement/evidentiary hearing, if a judicial settlement
is not possible.

Requiring INSS to, at the outset of proceedings,
state whether settlement is possible or to file an
answer still in a "preliminary settlement phase"
would greatly prejudice the Social Security Agency's
actions and defense. We explain:

In actions seeking Social
Assistance, it is impossible to propose settlement or contest the action before
the court-ordered medical examination or even before the administrative social
assessment (which will be conducted by INSS social workers). Indeed, in disputes
involving proof of disabling disability and/or the destitution of plaintiff's
family, it is materially impossible to reach settlement before
presentation of a medical report by a court expert; a report on the
family's economic conditions prepared by an INSS social worker
or one appointed by the court; and personal testimony of the opposing
party, from which confession may also be extracted. That is:
the settlement hearing, in such cases, as occurs
in cases involving rural workers,
must be held and necessarily coincide with the
evidentiary hearing, being immediately preceded by it.
We understand this is how it should be in all divisions of the
Federal Small Claims Courts.

Only after the settlement hearing
(which in our case is unified with the evidentiary hearing), if
conditions for settlement are not met, will INSS have all necessary elements to
file its answer, attaching at that
time all available evidence (plaintiff's administrative
file, social assessment conducted, medical opinion from
its technical assistant, etc.).

Therefore, the thirty-day period initially offered by the

Judiciary for defendant, in said cases, to propose
settlement, is merely a formal measure conventionally adopted,
incapable of producing the intended result, namely enabling
self-resolution of the dispute at the beginning of
judicial proceedings.

And it is precisely because of its ineffectiveness that said
30-day period does not satisfy the requirement established in Article 9 of Law No.
10,259/01, according to which INSS-defendant is guaranteed exercise of
its duty to produce its defense, including presentation of
all documentation available for resolution of the judicial
matter (Article 11 of the same law) until the time of
the settlement hearing, which, as stated, will inevitably
coincide with the evidentiary hearing, immediately
following it, as procedural logic informing the
special procedure of Federal Small Claims Courts requires, already consolidated by court practice.

Therefore, seeking to improve INSS's
defense, INSS requests application of said Article 9 of
Law No. 10,259/2001 and that the deadline for
filing the answer be considered as the time of the
settlement/evidentiary hearing.

Finally, even if plaintiff is under
guardianship, due to state court recognition of
absolute incapacity, such circumstance creates only a
rebuttable presumption (since INSS was not a party in the
guardianship proceedings) that the ward is incapable of managing his/her
own person and administering his/her assets, which does not
necessarily mean permanent inability to
perform any and all work activity from which he/she could
derive resources essential to his/her maintenance and for independent
living.

Therefore, court-ordered medical examination is also required,
which must focus precisely on the
specific requirements provided in governing legislation, without which
the social assistance benefit sought in the initial
claim cannot legitimately be granted. INSS thus requests
scheduling of medical examination even in cases of plaintiff being under guardianship.

ON THE MERITS

Having addressed the arguments above, INSS argues that
foreigners have no right to social assistance benefits because:
1) national economic development is insufficient to increase the range of social assistance
beneficiaries (principle of Selectivity and Distributiveness);
2) Article 203, V of the 1988 Constitution is a provision of limited effectiveness pending legislation;
3) Law 8,742/93 only covers CITIZENS;
4) expenses to be covered by payment of social assistance benefits to foreigners
in national territory have no funding source;
5) granting social assistance benefits to elderly and disabled foreigners may generate
immigration of destitute persons from countries neighboring Brazil.

Article 1 of Law 8,742/93 expressly provides that granting the social assistance
benefit has as a prerequisite the condition of "CITIZEN":

Article 1. Social assistance, the citizen's right and State's duty, is a
non-contributory Social Security Policy that provides basic
minimums, carried out through an integrated set of public
and social initiatives, to guarantee meeting basic
needs.

Implementing said provision, Article 7 of Decree 6,564/08, which
amends the Continuing Benefit regulations, approved by Decree No. 6,214 of
September 26, 2007, allows granting only to NATURALIZED foreigners:

"Article 7. The naturalized Brazilian, domiciled in Brazil, elderly or with
disability, observing the criteria established in this Regulation, who
does not receive any other benefit under Social Security or
any other system, national or foreign, except for medical
assistance and in case of receiving special indemnity pension,
observing the provisions of item VI of article 4, is also
a beneficiary of the Continuing Benefit."

As the best doctrine teaches, citizenship presupposes effective enjoyment of
individual, collective, social, and political rights, which are based on nationality.

In a unanimous decision at the trial session on
March 29, 2006, the distinguished Second Appellate Panel of the Federal Small Claims Courts of Porto Alegre
decided that foreigners have no right to receive the social assistance benefit provided
in Law 8,742/93:

II - OPINION
[...]
The controversy in this case is limited to the fact
that plaintiff, being a foreigner, not
naturalized, would not be entitled to the benefit. On this point,
the trial judge decided based on Article 4
of Decree 1,744/95.
Notwithstanding divergent understanding, I believe that
said Decree, by providing that elderly persons and
disabled foreigners who are naturalized and domiciled in
Brazil are also beneficiaries, provided they are not covered by the social
security system of their country of origin, came not to
clarify, but to confuse, when read together
with Article 1 of Law 8,742/93, which imposes, as a
prerequisite for the right to social assistance,
as previously seen, the condition of being a Brazilian
citizen.
The current notion of citizenship, as taught by Jose
Roberto Fernandes Castilho, concerns the effective enjoyment
of individual, collective, social, and
political rights (or participation in political life), all
based on nationality - the right to have rights
(on the classification of fundamental rights, see Jose
Afonso da Silva).
It is important to clarify from the outset that citizenship rights
are not confused with human rights,
although there is common ground between them. Dalmo
Dallari, for example, in texts and lectures, makes clear
this differentiation when analyzing, in depth, the
issue of human rights in today's world.
One can say, in short, that citizenship rights
concern public subjective rights
enshrined in a particular legal system,
concrete and specific. Human rights -
a much broader expression - refer to
the human person as the source-value of all
social values (Miguel Reale). Discussion of
human rights (right to life, right not to be
subjected to torture, right not to be enslaved,
right to nationality, etc.) is thus placed on
another plane of theoretical analysis. On the global,
universal plane, from a natural law perspective, not
positive and topical ("Citizenship: Outline of Evolution and
Meaning of the Expression" - Jose Roberto Fernandes
Castilho).
As can be seen, for the exercise of rights
inherent to citizenship, it is essential to enjoy the
status of national of the State that confers such
rights.
Since plaintiff does not have such status, I hold that the
principle of equality cannot be invoked in the concrete case
to support her claim, and the fact of
residing, as alleged, for more than 40 years in

Brazil, does not have the power to change that situation. It happens
that, for acquisition of Brazilian nationality, the
foreigner must expressly manifest this
desire and submit to a process with
administrative characteristics, processed
before the Ministry of Justice, and which has a
final formality of jurisdictional character, consisting of
delivery of the naturalization certificate by the competent
federal judge (Article 109, X, Constitution). "Until such
delivery occurs, the foreigner is not yet
Brazilian, and may even be excluded from
national territory" (Supreme Court, Plenary, HC 62,795-1-SP, Reporter
Justice Rafael Mayer, unanimous, Official Gazette, March 22, 1985, p. 3,623).
Thus, since plaintiff does not meet the prerequisite
of Brazilian citizenship, I hold that the appealed
judgment must be upheld as rendered.
I declare the constitutional matter raised in the appeal
preserved for review. I immediately exclude preservation
of infra-constitutional provisions. Indeed, there is no interest in
preserving infra-constitutional legislation, given
that in Small Claims Courts, special appeals are not allowed. The Superior
Court of Justice, in repeated and settled
jurisprudence now consolidated in a summary,
declared that: "Special appeals do not lie against decisions
rendered by second-instance bodies of Small Claims
Courts" (Summary 203).
In view of the foregoing, I deny the appeal filed
by plaintiff and order payment of
costs and attorney's fees, which I set at
10% of the amount in controversy, with execution suspended
by force of Article 12 of Law 1,060/50, as
beneficiary of free legal assistance.

We thus request dismissal of the claims.

Respectfully submitted.
