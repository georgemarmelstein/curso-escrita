In the city of Barcelona, on February 22, 2024

Seen in the name of H.M. the King in Oral and public Trial before Section 21 of this Provincial Court, the present case Summary 27/2023, originating from Summary 1/2023 of the Court of Instruction 15 of Barcelona, proceedings for a crime of sexual assault with penetration against the defendant Mr. DANIEL ALVES DA SILVA, of legal age, represented by Court Procurator Ms. Ana de Orovio Jorcano and defended by Attorney Ms. Ines Guardiola Sanchez, with the public prosecution exercised by the Public Prosecutor's Office and the private prosecution by Ms. VVVVV represented by Court Procurator Ms. Susana Puig Echeverria and assisted by Attorney Ms. Ester Garcia Lopez, and the Reporting Judge was Mr. Luis Belesta Segura, who expresses the unanimous opinion of the Court.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

FIRST.- The present summary proceedings were initiated by virtue of a communication from Hospital Clinic of Barcelona to the Duty Court on December 31, 2022. After the pertinent investigation, an order was issued agreeing to the indictment of DANIEL ALVES DA SILVA, declaring the case concluded and remitting the proceedings to this Chamber. Upon confirmation of the conclusion of the summary, an order opening oral proceedings was issued on November 9, 2023, subsequently completing the qualification procedure by the prosecutions and the defense of the accused, scheduling February 5, 6, and 7, 2024 for trial.

SECOND.- The Public Prosecutor raised as a preliminary matter the submission of new witnesses (officer 0000, the first to reach the victim, Inspector 000, those involved in the chain of custody, and medical practitioners 000 and 000). Additionally requested the admission of four documents related to the chain of custody and documents presented by the defense with its appeal against the order decreeing the preventive detention of Mr. Alves.

The private prosecution submitted as a preliminary matter new documentary evidence consisting of the medical report confirming the temporary disability of the complainant, dated December 21, 2023, and two press articles regarding Mr. Alves's appearances in the media.

The defense raised the following preliminary matters:
1.- Violation of the fundamental right to a process with all guarantees and to defense, pursuant to Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution in relation to articles 284 and 118 of the Criminal Procedure Law (LECrim).
2.- Violation of the fundamental right to a process with all guarantees and to means of evidence, Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution.
3.- Violation of the fundamental right to the presumption of innocence due to the parallel trial suffered in the media and its impact on the present proceedings.
4.- Injury to the right to an impartial judge, since the investigating judge was contaminated by the media.
5.- Excess of the prosecution briefs regarding the content of the indictment order, with expulsion from trial of those facts not contemplated in the order.
6.- Formal protest against the decision that the victim's statement be made behind closed doors, as well as its recording with voice and image distortion.
7.- Injury to the fundamental right to a process with all guarantees and to a fair trial, pursuant to Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution and Art. 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, due to the accumulation of all the above.

[PAGE 3]

The Court admitted the documentary evidence from both the prosecutions and the defense. And rejected the preliminary matters relating to violation of fundamental rights, as well as that relating to the exclusion of certain facts from trial, admitted the documentary and testimonial evidence proposed.

THIRD.- Once the evidence was presented, the Public Prosecutor elevated its provisional conclusions to final and classified the facts as legally constituting: ONE CRIME OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WITH PENETRATION under articles 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code, without the concurrence of circumstances modifying criminal responsibility. Therefore requested the imposition of the following penalties: NINE YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT, with the legal accessory of special disqualification for the right of passive suffrage during the time of the sentence, as well as the penalty of SUPERVISED RELEASE for a period of TEN YEARS.

The private prosecution requested the conviction of the defendant as the responsible author of a crime of sexual assault with vaginal penetration under articles 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code and a crime of injuries under article 147.2 of the Criminal Code. Therefore requested the imposition of the penalty of 12 years of imprisonment.

FOURTH.- For its part, the defense of the defendant requested his full acquittal.

PROVEN FACTS

On December 31, 2022, at approximately 02:45 hours, the defendant DANIEL ALVES DA SILVA, of legal age and with no criminal record, with dual Brazilian and Spanish nationality, went together with his friend AAA to the Sutton nightclub located at Calle Tuset No. 13 in Barcelona. Once inside, he accessed the reserved area called "Moet" and specifically was located at table No. 6, which has exclusive access to the reserved area called "Suite," of which the defendant had full knowledge as a regular customer of the nightclub and of that reserved area in particular.

Table 6 is adjacent to a door that provides access to said "Suite." Once through the door, there is a hallway where there is another door that provides access to a small restroom, as well as stairs that lead up to a room with a sofa, a television, and a refrigerator. Both the restroom and the room are for exclusive use by customers of table 6.

At approximately 02:30 hours on December 31, 2022, Ms. VVVVV entered the Sutton nightclub accompanied by her cousin BBB and her friend CCC. The three girls were in the general room and subsequently, around 02:50 hours, accessed the reserved area called "Moet" after being invited by a group of Mexican guys.

The defendant and his companion, after inviting two women to their table in the VIP area, asked a waiter to invite VVVVV and her two friends to have a glass of champagne with them. Initially the girls declined the invitation, although upon a second request by the waiter, they went to the table where Daniel Alves was with his friend, at 03:20 hours.

The defendant and Ms. VVVVV were talking and dancing together, without it being proven that the defendant grabbed the complainant's hand to place it on his penis or that Ms. VVVVV voluntarily touched the defendant's penis.

After having agreed with Ms. VVVV, at approximately 03:42 hours the defendant Daniel Alves went to the door adjacent to his table, which provides access to the so-called "Suite" and entered. Two minutes later Ms. VVV entered.

Once there, and without proof that the defendant inserted his penis into the complainant's mouth or that she voluntarily agreed to perform fellatio on Mr. Alves, the defendant attempted to vaginally penetrate the victim, for which, using his superior strength, he threw her to the floor, causing Ms. VVVVV to hit her knee.

The victim asked Daniel Alves to let her leave, that she wanted to get out of there, the defendant not allowing her. The victim, finding herself in this situation, in that small restroom without possibility of exit as Mr. Alves prevented it and given the violent attitude he displayed, felt overwhelmed and without capacity to react, even feeling short of breath given the situation of anguish and terror at what she was experiencing.

Nor has it been proven that Mr. Alves tried to perform oral sex on Ms. VVVVV by lifting her from the floor and placing her on the sink with her back to him.

Finally, the defendant using his physical strength, thereby overcoming the opposition of Ms. VVVVV, placed her bent over the toilet, where he vaginally penetrated her with his penis until he ejaculated inside her, without using a condom and without her consent.

Immediately afterward, at 04:00 hours, the defendant left the restroom leaving the victim there and went toward his table, where he grabbed a glass and moved away toward another table. A few seconds later the victim came out, went to her cousin and asked to leave the place, both doing so without saying goodbye to Daniel Alves, but they did to his companion.

Walking toward the exit of the nightclub, the victim burst into tears over what had happened, being attended to by nightclub staff, who activated the Sexual Assault Protocol.

The victim VVVVV was taken by ambulance to Hospital Clinic, where the corresponding medical examination was performed by the on-duty gynecologist and the forensic doctor, who collected samples from the victim's body and clothing for subsequent study, administering prophylactic treatment to her.

In the course of these events, the victim suffered injuries to her knee consisting of an abrasion of 2x1 cm at the inferolateral level of the left knee with three adjacent bruises, the largest 1 cm in diameter, leaving as a sequel a scar, according to the forensic doctor's report, which required only one medical visit for healing.

Likewise, the victim presents anxious-depressive symptomatology with somatizations, compatible with a disorder secondary to a stressful or traumatic event. The victim currently suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder of globally elevated intensity, with functional repercussions and deterioration in several areas of functioning, receiving treatment for it.

LEGAL GROUNDS

[Summary of key findings:]

1. The Court found that the victim entered the private Suite voluntarily after agreeing with the defendant based on security camera footage analysis.

2. However, the Court determined that what occurred inside the bathroom was a non-consensual sexual assault.

3. The victim's testimony was found credible regarding the core facts of the assault despite inconsistencies regarding events before entering the Suite.

4. DNA evidence (smegma) found in the victim's mouth could indicate oral penetration, though this was not conclusively proven.

5. The injury to the victim's knee was consistent with being thrown to the floor.

6. The Court applied the mitigating circumstance of reparation of damage due to the deposit of 150,000 euros before trial.

JUDGMENT (FALLO)

We CONVICT D. ALVES DA SILVA as criminally responsible author of a crime of rape under articles 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code, with the mitigating circumstance of reparation of damage under article 21.5 of the Criminal Code applying, to the penalty of:

- FOUR YEARS AND SIX MONTHS of imprisonment
- Special disqualification for the right of passive suffrage during the time of the sentence
- SUPERVISED RELEASE for a period of FIVE YEARS
- Prohibition from approaching the victim within 1000 meters for nine years and six months
- Prohibition of communication with the victim by any means for nine years and six months
- Special disqualification for employment related to minors for NINE YEARS AND SIX MONTHS

In terms of civil liability:
- The defendant shall compensate the victim in the amount of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND EUROS

WE CONVICT D. ALVES DA SILVA as criminally responsible author of a minor crime of injuries to the penalty of 2 months' fine with a daily rate of 150 euros.

The defendant is sentenced to pay the procedural costs, including those of the private prosecution.

NEW PROVEN FACTS (as redrafted by the Appeals Court):

1. On December 31, 2022, at approximately 02:45 hours, D.A.d.S. went together with his friend T1 to the Sutton nightclub in Barcelona. He accessed the reserved VIP area "Moet" and was located at table No. 6, which has exclusive access to the "Suite."

5. From the biological report, through analysis of the buccal swab collected from the complainant, traces of smegma matching the DNA of D.A.d.S. were detected.

6. The complainant had an injury to her left knee. When the trial was held, she was on sick leave for generalized anxiety.

7. D.A. deposited the amount of 150,000 euros.

KEY LEGAL FINDINGS:

ON CREDIBILITY OF THE COMPLAINANT'S TESTIMONY:

"We do not share the reasoning of the Trial Court. The fact of offering an account objectively discordant with reality interferes very significantly in the analysis of a witness's reliability. We must take into account that, in this case, this account is not the result of an impulse or a moment of confusion. The complainant has consistently maintained this version (until the moment of the oral trial) that does not correspond to reality even knowing, through her legal counsel, the existence of the recording and its content."

"This untruthfulness significantly affects the reliability of the information the witness provides, and this requires maximum rigor in the scrutiny of the rest of the account and intensifying the objective requirements of reliability."

ON CORROBORATION:

"In conclusion, the declaration that there was non-consensual vaginal penetration lacks peripheral corroboration, and the elements considered do not accredit it; there is only her statement."

ON THE STANDARD OF PROOF:

"What we affirm is that, from the evidence presented, it cannot be concluded that the standards required by the presumption of innocence have been met in accordance with Art. 24.2 of the Spanish Constitution and Art. 6 of Directive (EU) 2016/343 of the European Parliament and Council of March 9, 2016, which expressly establishes: '1. Member States shall ensure that the burden of proof for establishing the guilt of suspects and accused persons rests on the prosecution. 2. Member States shall ensure that any doubt as to the guilt always benefits the suspect or accused person, including when the court assesses whether the person concerned should be acquitted.'"

"What is determinative is that, for the reasons we have explained in the resolution, the evidentiary insufficiencies that have been expressed lead to the conclusion that the standard required by the presumption of innocence has not been met."

RULING (FALLO):

In light of the above, WE RULE:

1. NOT TO GRANT the appeals filed by the Public Prosecutor and by the Private Prosecution against the judgment of February 22, 2024 of the Barcelona Provincial Court (Twenty-First Section).

2. TO GRANT the appeal filed by the legal representation of D.A.d.S. We fully REVOKE the judgment issued at first instance.

3. We must ACQUIT and we DO ACQUIT D.A.d.S. of the crime of sexual assault of which he was being accused.

4. The precautionary measures adopted are SET ASIDE.

5. We declare the procedural costs of this second instance to be paid EX OFFICIO.

Notify this resolution to the parties present, informing them that an appeal in cassation may be filed before the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court in the terms provided in Art. 847 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

This is our judgment which we sign and order.

PUBLICATION. The above Judgment was read, signed, and published on the same day as its date. I certify.
