In the city of Barcelona, on February 22, 2024

Seen in the name of H.M. the King in Oral and public Trial before Section 21 of this Provincial Court, the present case Summary 27/2023, originating from Summary 1/2023 of the Court of Instruction 15 of Barcelona, proceedings for a crime of sexual assault with penetration against the defendant Mr. DANIEL ALVES DA SILVA, of legal age, represented by Court Procurator Ms. Ana de Orovio Jorcano and defended by Attorney Ms. Ines Guardiola Sanchez, with the public prosecution exercised by the Public Prosecutor's Office and the private prosecution by Ms. VVVVV represented by Court Procurator Ms. Susana Puig Echeverria and assisted by Attorney Ms. Ester Garcia Lopez, and the Reporting Judge was Mr. Luis Belesta Segura, who expresses the unanimous opinion of the Court.

PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

FIRST.- The present summary proceedings were initiated by virtue of a communication from Hospital Clinic of Barcelona to the Duty Court on December 31, 2022. After the pertinent investigation, an order was issued agreeing to the indictment of DANIEL ALVES DA SILVA, declaring the case concluded and remitting the proceedings to this Chamber. Upon confirmation of the conclusion of the summary, an order opening oral proceedings was issued on November 9, 2023, subsequently completing the qualification procedure by the

Administration of justice in Catalonia

prosecutions and the defense of the accused, scheduling February 5, 6, and 7, 2024 for trial.

SECOND.- The Public Prosecutor raised as a preliminary matter the submission of new witnesses (officer 0000, the first to reach the victim, Inspector 000, those involved in the chain of custody, and medical practitioners 000 and 000). Additionally requested the admission of four documents related to the chain of custody and documents presented by the defense with its appeal against the order decreeing the preventive detention of Mr. Alves.

The private prosecution submitted as a preliminary matter new documentary evidence consisting of the medical report confirming the temporary disability of the complainant, dated December 21, 2023, and two press articles regarding Mr. Alves's appearances in the media.

The defense raised the following preliminary matters:
1.- Violation of the fundamental right to a process with all guarantees and to defense, pursuant to Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution in relation to articles 284 and 118 of the Criminal Procedure Law (LECrim).
2.- Violation of the fundamental right to a process with all guarantees and to means of evidence, Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution.
3.- Violation of the fundamental right to the presumption of innocence due to the parallel trial suffered in the media and its impact on the present proceedings.
4.- Injury to the right to an impartial judge, since the investigating judge was contaminated by the media.
5.- Excess of the prosecution briefs regarding the content of the indictment order, with expulsion from trial of those facts not contemplated in the order.
6.- Formal protest against the decision that the victim's statement be made behind closed doors, as well as its recording with voice and image distortion.
7.- Injury to the fundamental right to a process with all guarantees and to a fair trial, pursuant to Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution and Art. 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, due to the accumulation of all the above.

Regarding means of evidence, new documentary evidence was submitted, specifying the aspects on which the challenge to the prosecution's documentary evidence was based, withdrawing the challenge regarding others. The biological expert evidence was also waived. And it was requested that the defendant testify last. Likewise, requested that officers of the Regional Police 000, 000, and 000 proposed by the prosecutions testify. Also requested that witnesses not be allowed to communicate with each other and that the testimony of these and the defendant be conducted with exhibition of security camera videos. Waived the testimony of the complainant's mother.

The Court admitted the documentary evidence from both the prosecutions and the defense. And rejected the preliminary matters relating to violation of fundamental rights, as well as that relating to the exclusion of certain facts from trial, admitted the documentary and testimonial evidence proposed, denied that witnesses testify with exhibition of videos, as this was impracticable, besides being documentary evidence, which this Court could contrast since video viewing had been requested. It was ordered that witnesses could not communicate with each other. Waiver of experts and witnesses was noted. And it was ordered that the defendant testify last because this could contribute to clarifying the facts, especially considering that the prosecutions had requested new testimonial evidence, but not because this guaranteed the right to defense.

THIRD.- Once the evidence was presented, the Public Prosecutor elevated its provisional conclusions to final and classified the facts as legally constituting: ONE CRIME OF SEXUAL ASSAULT WITH PENETRATION under articles 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code, (according to the wording given by Organic Law 10/2022 of September 6 as more favorable to the defendant) without the concurrence of circumstances modifying criminal responsibility. Therefore requested the imposition of the following penalties: NINE YEARS OF IMPRISONMENT, with the legal accessory of special disqualification for the right of passive suffrage during the time of the sentence, as well as the penalty of SUPERVISED RELEASE for a period of TEN YEARS, which must be executed after completion of the prison sentence in accordance with article 192.1 of the Criminal Code. Pursuant to articles 57 and 48 of the Criminal Code, it is appropriate to order as an accessory penalty the prohibition that the defendant approach VVVVV as well as her home, workplace, or any other place where she may be, within 1,000 meters and prohibition of communicating with her by any means of communication or computer or telematic means, written, verbal, or visual contact, for a period exceeding by ten years the prison sentence imposed in the Judgment. And to payment of procedural costs.

In terms of civil liability, requested that the defendant compensate the complainant in the amount of 150,000 euros for the physical and psychological injuries and moral damages suffered, amounts that must be increased as provided in article 576 of the Civil Procedure Law.

The private prosecution requested the conviction of the defendant as the responsible author of a crime of sexual assault with vaginal penetration, classified under articles 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code and a crime of injuries under article 147.2 of the Criminal Code, without the concurrence of circumstances modifying criminal responsibility. Therefore requested the imposition of the following

[PAGE 4]

4/61

Administration of justice in Catalonia

penalties: 1) For the crime of sexual assault with carnal access, the penalty of 12 years of imprisonment and special disqualification for the exercise of the right of passive suffrage during the time of the sentence.
2) For the crime of injuries under Art. 147.2, the penalty of 3 months' fine with a daily rate of 150 euros.
Pursuant to Art. 57.1 of the Criminal Code, as an ACCESSORY PENALTY the defendant shall be prohibited from approaching within 1,000 meters of Ms. VVVV, her home, and places she frequents, as well as prohibition of communication by any means, both for ten years beyond the custodial sentence imposed, regarding the first crime, and one year beyond the sentence, regarding the crime of injuries.
Likewise, the security measure of supervised release shall be imposed for a period of ten years to be served by the defendant, once criminal liability is extinguished pursuant to article 192.1 of the Criminal Code.

In terms of civil liability, requested that the defendant be ordered to compensate Ms. VVVVV in the sum of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND EUROS (150,000 euros) taking into account the physical and psychological injuries suffered. Likewise, requested that he be ordered to pay the costs incurred in the proceedings, including those of the private prosecution.

FOURTH.- For its part, the defense of the defendant requested his full acquittal. And as a first alternative, considers that the error of type under article 14.1 of the Criminal Code would apply. As a second alternative, the following circumstances modifying criminal responsibility would apply: the incomplete exemption of intoxication under article 21.1 of the Criminal Code in relation to article 20.2 of the Criminal Code; the highly qualified mitigating circumstance of reparation of damage under article 21.5 of the Criminal Code and the analogous mitigating circumstance under article 21.7 of the Criminal Code in relation to the violation of fundamental rights, requesting the imposition of a sentence of one year of imprisonment and that civil liability be set at 150,000 euros.

Subsequently, the parties made such arguments as they deemed appropriate in support of their qualifications, declaring the trial concluded for judgment once the defendant was given the opportunity to make a final statement.


PROVEN FACTS

On December 31, 2022, at approximately 02:45 hours, the defendant DANIEL ALVES DA SILVA, of legal age and with no criminal record, with dual Brazilian and Spanish nationality, with ID number XXXXX, went together with his friend AAA to the Sutton nightclub located at Calle Tuset No. 13 in Barcelona. Once inside, he accessed the reserved area called

[PAGE 5]

5/61

Administration of justice in Catalonia

"Moet" and specifically was located at table No. 6, which has exclusive access to the reserved area called "Suite," of which the defendant had full knowledge as a regular customer of the nightclub and of that reserved area in particular.

Table 6 is adjacent to a door that provides access to said "Suite." Once through the door, there is a hallway where there is another door that provides access to a small restroom, as well as stairs that lead up to a room with a sofa, a television, and a refrigerator. Both the restroom and the room are for exclusive use by customers of table 6. Once Daniel Alves and his companion occupied table 6, an employee of the Sutton nightclub placed a barrier separating table 6 and the door to the "Suite" from the rest of the VIP "Moet" area.

At approximately 02:30 hours on December 31, 2022, Ms. VVVVV, born on......, entered the Sutton nightclub accompanied by her cousin BBB and her friend CCC. The three girls were in the general room and subsequently, around 02:50 hours, accessed the reserved area called "Moet" after being invited by a group of Mexican guys.

The defendant and his companion, after inviting two women to their table in the VIP area, asked a waiter to invite VVVVV and her two friends to have a glass of champagne with them. Initially the girls declined the invitation, although upon a second request by the waiter, they went to the table where Daniel Alves was with his friend, at 03:20 hours.

Upon arriving at the mentioned table No. 6, the other two women previously referred to left the place, leaving only the two men and Ms. VVVVV and her two companions. The defendant, who had at his table a bottle of rosé Champagne Moet magnum, 1.5 liters, invited each of the girls to a glass of champagne, and the five were dancing and chatting in the area of table No. 6. The defendant and Ms. VVVVV were talking and dancing together, without it being proven that the defendant grabbed the complainant's hand to place it on his penis or that Ms. VVVVV voluntarily touched the defendant's penis.

After having agreed with Ms. VVVV, at approximately 03:42 hours the defendant Daniel Alves went to the door adjacent to his table, which provides access to the so-called "Suite" and entered. Two minutes later Ms. VVV entered.

Once there, and without proof that the defendant inserted his penis into the complainant's mouth or that she voluntarily agreed to perform fellatio on Mr. Alves, the defendant attempted to vaginally penetrate the victim, for which, using his superior strength, he threw her to the floor, causing Ms. VVVVV to hit her knee.

[PAGE 6]

Administration of justice in Catalonia

The victim asked Daniel Alves to let her leave, that she wanted to get out of there, the defendant not allowing her. The victim, finding herself in this situation, in that small restroom without possibility of exit as Mr. Alves prevented it and given the violent attitude he displayed, felt overwhelmed and without capacity to react, even feeling short of breath given the situation of anguish and terror at what she was experiencing.

Nor has it been proven that Mr. Alves tried to perform oral sex on Ms. VVVVV by lifting her from the floor and placing her on the sink with her back to him.

Finally, the defendant using his physical strength, thereby overcoming the opposition of Ms. VVVVV, placed her bent over the toilet, where he vaginally penetrated her with his penis until he ejaculated inside her, without using a condom and without her consent.

Immediately afterward, at 04:00 hours, the defendant left the restroom leaving the victim there and went toward his table, where he grabbed a glass and moved away toward another table. A few seconds later the victim came out, went to her cousin and asked to leave the place, both doing so without saying goodbye to Daniel Alves, but they did to his companion.

Walking toward the exit of the nightclub, the victim burst into tears over what had happened, being attended to by nightclub staff, who activated the Sexual Assault Protocol. While Sutton staff attended to the crying victim in the exit hallway of the nightclub, Mr. Alves and his companion quickly left at 04:06 hours, passing by Ms. VVVVV and her friends in said hallway without saying a word to her or her friends.

The victim VVVVV was taken by ambulance to Hospital Clinic, where the corresponding medical examination was performed by the on-duty gynecologist and the forensic doctor, who collected samples from the victim's body and clothing for subsequent study, administering prophylactic treatment to her.

In the course of these events, the victim suffered injuries to her knee consisting of an abrasion of 2x1 cm at the inferolateral level of the left knee with three adjacent bruises, the largest 1 cm in diameter, leaving as a sequel a scar, according to the forensic doctor's report, which required only one medical visit for healing.

Likewise, the victim presents anxious-depressive symptomatology with somatizations, compatible with a disorder secondary to a stressful or traumatic event, with post-traumatic symptomatology persisting at a globally elevated intensity with functional repercussions at occupational and social levels, it not being possible to determine what proportion of the symptomatology is exclusively related to the traumatic event suffered and what would be modulated by subsequent environmental stress acting as an additional

[PAGE 7]

anxiety-producing enhancer.

The victim presents active post-traumatic symptomatology with significant psychometric indicators in all its components or symptomatic factors: the impact is significant on the person's functioning with affectation of personal, socio-family, and physical and mental health areas; no characterological or baseline personality indicators that are dysfunctional or maladaptive prior to the events are found. The victim currently suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder of globally elevated intensity, with functional repercussions and deterioration in several areas of functioning, receiving treatment for it. As of the date of the trial, she continued on sick leave, since the events occurred.

LEGAL GROUNDS

FIRST.- PRELIMINARY MATTERS. Despite having been dismissed orally by the Court, after due deliberation, the violations of rights, arguing them at the hearing or referring to the order of November 9, 2023 of this Chamber or others, we will make a brief reference to some of the preliminary matters raised by the defense of Mr. Alves regarding the nullity of proceedings in relation to the cited order, whose argumentation we will collect substantially to facilitate any appeal that the parties may file against this judgment and the understanding and knowledge of the superior court about what was decided.

1.- Regarding the first preliminary matter, focused on the violation of the right to a process with all guarantees, the defense indicates that from the first moment the defendant was identified, so in accordance with article 284.1 of the Criminal Procedure Law the judicial authority should have been immediately informed of the crime and presumed perpetrator and pursuant to article 118 of the same legal text Mr. Alves should have been informed so he could exercise the right to defense from the first moment. And on December 31, 2022, the Court of Instruction issued an order of provisional dismissal. It indicates that if proceedings had been brought against him that same day, he could have submitted to, for example, a blood alcohol test.

Subsequently, the defendant would have had this right violated upon the Court receiving the supplementary police report and only ordering the reopening of proceedings, "delaying knowledge and communication of the pending criminal process to my client." Nor would the Court have done so when on January 16, 2023 it received the supplementary police report containing CDs with more than 20 hours of recordings.

[PAGE 8]

Administration of justice in Catalonia

It alleges that on January 17, 2023, the appearance of Procurator Ana de Orovio Jorcano in the case was denied orally.

Finally, when he was arrested, part of the case was given to the defense, containing some sentences crossed out or with correction fluid and having less than two hours to review and speak with her client. And it was not until after his judicial statement that the recordings were provided.

The preliminary matter must be dismissed. As is well known, it is common in crimes against sexual freedom for the notitia criminis to come from the hospital where the victim is examined. Being a semi-public crime, it is necessary that the victim first file a complaint. In the present case, the victim did not file a complaint until January 2, 2023 at 18:49, as recorded at page 14 of the case file.

The action of the Court of Instruction was correct; upon receiving the communication, it ordered that she be seen by the forensic doctor, ordered the dismissal of the case until it could be reopened with the filing of the complaint.

On January 5, 2023, a supplementary police report was received by the Court of Instruction 15, where, after explaining the facts, it was indicated that "this UCAS initiates the appropriate investigative actions to clarify the facts, it being pertinent to hear various witnesses in statement, as well as viewing images from the security cameras of the SUTTON nightclub, among other procedures. Let the present serve to inform Your Honor of the first notice of the event, and the result of the procedures carried out will be duly reported in supplementary proceedings."

In response to this communication, the Court of Instruction issued on January 9, 2023 an order ordering that the proceedings be reopened, awaiting the Regional Police to provide the recordings.

On January 16, 2023, a supplementary police report with more information and statements was received by this Court. That same day, an order was issued with the following content: "upon receipt of the above supplements, they shall be joined to the proceedings, awaiting the procedures pending by the Regional Police, especially the location and identification of the accused, and upon their result a decision will be made."

On January 20, 2023, Mr. Daniel Alves was presented to the Court of Instruction as a detainee.

Parallel to the judicial course, we have learned from the statements of the Regional Police who testified at the trial that the defense of Mr. Alves was informed from the first moment of the proceedings being brought against him. This was stated by Regional Police Officer 000, the Investigating Officer of the police report. According to this witness, it was decided to make a first official communication to the court. With the statement of the victim and the accused person. There they indicate they will continue with the procedures. The police report was presented, she believes, about 10 days later. During that time they contacted Alves's lawyer. She even appeared at the police station on the day of the

[PAGE 9]

victim's police statement. She also had telephone conversations with her. They also asked her for information about the accused and his companion while at the same time trying to find out when he could come to the police station. The procedures were for him to appear before the unit.

On the other hand, from the emails provided by the Public Prosecutor in the preliminary matters procedure, it is evident that Mr. Alves's attorney, Ms. Miraida Puente, was in contact with UCAS, having exchanged at least since January 11, 2023 emails with this unit and with the other attorneys assisting Mr. Alves.

It does not appear in the case file, other than through the statements of the current defense attorney, that the appearance of the Procurator on behalf of the defendant was denied orally.

It is not considered that an investigation took place without the knowledge of the defendant, who, incidentally, traveled to Mexico the day after the events, nor that any right has been violated.

As for the time available to review the contents of the case, the current attorney says this "from hearsay" since she was not the one who assisted the detainee, unknown if for his previous attorney or attorneys the time available was sufficient. In any case, if it was not, they could have requested more time from the Court, which does not appear to have been done.

And regarding the parts of the police report with correction fluid or crossed out, these only refer to the personal data of the complainant and witnesses, whose respective names or the position they hold and in what capacity they testified could be read, so their lack of knowledge does not cause any defenselessness.

2.- Regarding the denial of means of evidence, due to the intervention of the defense expert Dr. Blanca Navarro in the forensic medical examination of the victim, we already ruled in our order admitting evidence dated December 18, 2023 where we said that: There is no place for new psychiatric expert examination of the complainant with examination by Drs. Blanca Navarro and Jaime Ayguade. And this without prejudice to the experts issuing such report as they consider appropriate in view of the documentation in the proceedings.

On the one hand, the Statute of the Victim of Crime in its article 21 limits medical examinations of victims, which must be reduced to a minimum. And on the other hand, it does not appear that the defense expert was prevented, in accordance with what was established by Section 3 of this Provincial Court in its order of May 3, 2023, from accessing the examination carried out by the forensic doctors. In this regard, there is the order of May 23, 2023 where it was indicated that the complainant could be accompanied by the psychologist Silvia Moreira and the expert designated by the defense could attend when she was examined on June 13, 2023. And on July 12, 2023, a brief was received by the Court of Instruction presented by the defense of Mr. Alves in which it expressly stated "that the last investigative procedure was the forensic examination of the complainant by the IMLCFC on June 13, 2023. The passage of a month without the corresponding forensic medical report having been issued and without another investigative procedure pending is causing unreasonable procedural delay..."

Neither was the attendance of the defense expert denied, nor did the defense of Mr. Alves indicate this point in his brief of July 12.

In fact, at the trial Dr. Navarro testified, stating that she was present at the psychological examination together with Dr. Mateu. The forensic medical examination had already been performed. She also stated that she could not properly ask what she would have wished, so as not to have a conflict in front of the victim with the psychologist Dr. Mateu. And although she brought these facts to the attention of the defense attorney at the time, he was satisfied since, as stated, he requested that the report be obtained from the forensic doctor, without ever requesting a new expert examination or expansion of Dr. Navarro's powers in the examination. We understand that there has been no violation of the right to defense of Mr. Alves nor has the evidence been carried out irregularly, so the dismissal of this preliminary matter is appropriate.

3.- Regarding the existence of a parallel trial, we also referred to it in the order of November 9, 2023: "This Court cannot but admit that the principle of presumption of innocence protects any person, even in the extra-procedural sphere, as recognized by the Constitutional Court and the European Court of Human Rights. This extra-procedural dimension prevents treating as guilty someone who has not been so declared after a prior fair trial or casting doubt on someone who has been acquitted by final judgment.

Criminal proceedings affecting public figures have undoubted media repercussions. And frequently the facts are debated in different media, including analysis of evidence, and opinions are expressed that may violate the principle of presumption of innocence in its extra-procedural aspect, even though they do not come from authorities or public officials.

However, these attacks on the presumption of innocence do not have intra-procedural consequences, but must be prevented or, as the case may be, repaired from the sphere of protection of the right to honor. In no way can they mean the nullity of everything done in the proceedings.

Regarding the leaks that have existed throughout the processing of the case, this Court regrets them. But it regrets them as much in this case as in all cases. And likewise regrets the existence of so-called 'parallel trials.' But this does not mean the nullity of the investigation, nor is the procedure under article 627 of the Criminal Procedure Law the mechanism through which these leaks should be corrected, as they have no direct impact on the case."

These reflections made in the procedure under article 627 of the Criminal Procedure Law are maintained at this time, especially considering that, by virtue of the documents provided by the private prosecution at the beginning of the oral trial hearing, the existence of a parallel trial as well as leaks could also be attributed to the defendant's own circle. In any case, they have no bearing on the violation of the principle of presumption of innocence at a procedural level.

[The document continues with extensive legal analysis of the evidence, witness testimony, and the court's reasoning for conviction. Key findings include:]

LEGAL GROUNDS (Summary of key points):

- DNA evidence (smegma) found in the victim's mouth could indicate oral penetration, though this was not conclusively proven
- The injury to the victim's knee was consistent with being thrown to the floor
- The victim exhibited symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder
- The Court applied the mitigating circumstance of reparation of damage due to the deposit of 150,000 euros
