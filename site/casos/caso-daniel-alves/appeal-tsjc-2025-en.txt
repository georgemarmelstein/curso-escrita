PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND

ACCEPTING the background facts of the appealed judgment, and

1. The appealed judgment declared the following facts proven: "On December 31, 2022, at approximately 02:45 hours, the defendant D.A.D.S., of legal age and with no criminal record, with dual Brazilian and Spanish nationality, with ID number 0000000, went together with his friend T1 to the Sutton nightclub located at Calle Tuset No. 13 in Barcelona. Once inside, he accessed the reserved area called 'Moet' and specifically was located at table No. 6, which has exclusive access to the reserved area called 'Suite,' of which the defendant had full knowledge as a regular customer of the nightclub and of that reserved area in particular.

Table 6 is adjacent to a door that provides access to said 'Suite.' Once through the door, there is a hallway where there is another door that provides access to a small restroom, as well as stairs that lead up to a room with a sofa, a television, and a refrigerator. Both the restroom and the room are for exclusive use by customers of table 6. Once D.A. and his companion occupied table 6, an employee of the Sutton nightclub placed a barrier separating table 6 and the door to the 'Suite' from the rest of the VIP 'Moet' area.

At approximately 02:30 hours on December 31, 2022, Ms. [COMPLAINANT], born on [DATE] 1999, entered the Sutton nightclub accompanied by her cousin T2 and her friend T3. The three girls were in the general room and subsequently, around 02:50 hours, accessed the reserved area called 'Moet' after being invited by a group of Mexican guys.

[PAGE 3]

The defendant and his companion, after inviting two women to their table in the VIP area, asked a waiter to invite [COMPLAINANT] and her two friends to have a glass of champagne with them. Initially the girls declined the invitation, although upon a second request by the waiter, they went to the table where D.A. was with his friend, at 03:20 hours.

Upon arriving at the mentioned table No. 6, the other two women previously referred to left the place, leaving only the two men and Ms. [COMPLAINANT] and her two companions. The defendant, who had at his table a bottle of rose Champagne Moet magnum, 1.5 liters, invited each of the girls to a glass of champagne, and the five were dancing and chatting in the area of table No. 6. The defendant and Ms. [COMPLAINANT] were talking and dancing together, without it being proven that the defendant grabbed the complainant's hand to place it on his penis or that Ms. [COMPLAINANT] voluntarily touched the defendant's penis.

After having agreed with Ms. [COMPLAINANT], at approximately 03:42 hours the defendant D.A. went to the door adjacent to his table, which provides access to the so-called 'Suite' and entered. Two minutes later Ms. [COMPLAINANT] entered.

Once there, and without proof that the defendant inserted his penis into the complainant's mouth or that she voluntarily agreed to perform fellatio on Mr. A., the defendant attempted to vaginally penetrate the victim, for which, using his superior strength, he threw her to the floor, causing Ms. [COMPLAINANT] to hit her knee.

The victim asked D.A. to let her leave, that she wanted to get out of there, the defendant not allowing her. The victim, finding herself in this situation, in that small restroom without possibility of exit as Mr. A. prevented it and given the violent attitude he displayed, felt overwhelmed and without capacity to react, even feeling short of breath given the situation of anguish and terror at what she was experiencing.

Nor has it been proven that Mr. A. tried to perform oral sex on Ms. [COMPLAINANT] by lifting her from the floor and placing her on the sink with her back to him.

[PAGE 4]

Finally, the defendant using his physical strength, thereby overcoming the opposition of Ms. [COMPLAINANT], placed her bent over the toilet, where he vaginally penetrated her with his penis until he ejaculated inside her, without using a condom and without her consent.

Immediately afterward, at 04:00 hours, the defendant left the restroom leaving the victim there and went toward his table, where he grabbed a glass and moved away toward another table. A few seconds later the victim came out, went to her cousin and asked to leave the place, both doing so without saying goodbye to D.A., but they did to his companion.

Walking toward the exit of the nightclub, the victim burst into tears over what had happened, being attended to by nightclub staff, who activated the Sexual Assault Protocol. While Sutton staff attended to the crying victim in the exit hallway of the nightclub, Mr. A. and his companion quickly left at 04:06 hours, passing by Ms. [COMPLAINANT] and her friends in said hallway without saying a word to her or her friends.

The victim [COMPLAINANT] was taken by ambulance to Hospital Clinic, where the corresponding medical examination was performed by the on-duty gynecologist and the forensic doctor, who collected samples from the victim's body and clothing for subsequent study, administering prophylactic treatment to her.

In the course of these events, the victim suffered injuries to her knee consisting of an abrasion of 2x1 cm at the inferolateral level of the left knee with three adjacent bruises, the largest 1 cm in diameter, leaving as a sequel a scar, according to the forensic doctor's report, which required only one medical visit for healing.

[PAGE 5]

Likewise, the victim presents anxious-depressive symptomatology with somatizations, compatible with a disorder secondary to a stressful or traumatic event, with post-traumatic symptomatology persisting at a globally elevated intensity with functional repercussions at occupational and social levels, it not being possible to determine what proportion of the symptomatology is exclusively related to the traumatic event suffered and what would be modulated by subsequent environmental stress acting as an additional anxiety-producing enhancer.

The victim presents active post-traumatic symptomatology with significant psychometric indicators in all its components or symptomatic factors: the impact is significant on the person's functioning with affectation of personal, socio-family, and physical and mental health areas; no characterological or baseline personality indicators that are dysfunctional or maladaptive prior to the events are found. The victim currently suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder of globally elevated intensity, with functional repercussions and deterioration in several areas of functioning, receiving treatment for it. As of the date of the trial, she continued on sick leave, since the events occurred."

2. Said Judgment contains the following ruling: "We CONVICT D.A.D.S. as criminally responsible author of a crime of rape under articles 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code, with the mitigating circumstance of reparation of damage under article 21.5 of the Criminal Code applying, to the penalty of FOUR YEARS AND SIX MONTHS of imprisonment, with the legal accessory of special disqualification for the right of passive suffrage during the time of the sentence, as well as the penalty of SUPERVISED RELEASE for a period of FIVE YEARS, which must be executed after completion of the prison sentence in accordance with article 192.1 of the Criminal Code.

Likewise, as an accessory penalty, the defendant is prohibited from approaching [COMPLAINANT] as well as her home and workplace, or any other place frequented by her, within a radius of 1000 meters, and prohibited from communicating with her by any means, for a period of nine years and six months.

Equally imposed is the penalty of special disqualification for employment, public office, profession, or trade related to minors for a period of 5 years beyond the custodial sentence imposed, that is NINE YEARS AND SIX MONTHS.

[PAGE 6]

In terms of civil liability, the defendant shall compensate [COMPLAINANT] in the amount of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND EUROS for the moral damage suffered and injuries caused. Said amounts shall accrue legal interest increased by two points in accordance with Art. 576 of the Civil Procedure Law.

WE CONVICT D.A.D.S. as criminally responsible author of a minor crime of injuries to the penalty of 2 months' fine with a daily rate of 150 euros, with the subsidiary personal liability in case of non-payment under article 53 of the Criminal Code.

For compliance with the sentence imposed, all time that the defendant has been deprived of liberty for this cause is declared applicable and must be credited, provided it has not been credited in any other case.

The defendant is sentenced to pay the procedural costs, including those of the private prosecution."

3. Against the mentioned judgment, an appeal was filed by the legal representation of D.A.d.S., of [COMPLAINANT], and by the Public Prosecutor, basing it on the grounds contained in the various briefs articulating the appeals.

4. On February 27, a clarification order was issued on the judgment in which, partially granting the defense's proposal, the mention of the fourth background regarding the final conclusions was modified to state that civil liability was set at 50,000 euros, with the following wording: "Where it says requesting the imposition of a sentence of one year of imprisonment and that civil liability be established at 150,000 euros," must read: requesting the imposition of a sentence of one year of imprisonment and civil liability of 50,000 euros." (..) "There is no place for supplementation of the proven facts."

Once the appeal was admitted and transferred for ten days to the parties to present briefs of opposition or adhesion, the Defense's appeal was opposed by the Public Prosecutor and by the Private Prosecution, and the appeals of the prosecutions were opposed by the defense of D.A.

[PAGE 7]

The case was received in the Court's secretariat on June 21, 2024, evidence having been requested at second instance which has been resolved by order of February 18, 2025, and on appeal by order of March 17, 2025.

The matter, which is not urgent as it is not a case with a prisoner, nor preferential, as it does not affect minors nor has it been followed before the Jury Court, has been submitted to the ordinary turn of distribution in accordance with the rules in force.

PROVEN FACTS

SOLE.- The facts thus declared in the first instance judgment are not fully admitted as such. And they are drafted as follows:

NEW PROVEN FACTS

1. On December 31, 2022, at approximately 02:45 hours, D.A.d.S. went together with his friend T1 to the Sutton nightclub located at Calle Tuset No. 13 in Barcelona. Once inside, he accessed the reserved VIP area called "Moet" and was located at table No. 6, which has exclusive access to the reserved area called "Suite" with which it is adjacent, the space of said table being separated from the rest of the VIP area by a barrier. The Suite consists of a hallway where there is another door that provides access to a small restroom, as well as stairs that lead up to a room with a sofa, a television, and a refrigerator.

2. At approximately 02:30 hours on December 31, 2022, [COMPLAINANT] entered the Sutton nightclub accompanied by her cousin T2 and her friend T3. After having been in the general room, and having then accessed, around 02:50, the reserved VIP area "Moet" invited by a group of Mexican guys, at 03:20 hours they moved, by express invitation, to table 6 where D.A. was with his friend T1.

2. The five had drinks from the champagne bottle, danced and chatted in the sectioned-off area of table No. 6. D.A. and [COMPLAINANT], in

[PAGE 8]

particular, were talking and dancing together more closely and intimately, agreeing to enter the private area of the reserved area where they were.

Thus, at 03:42 hours D.A. went to the door adjacent to his table, and entered the "Suite." Two minutes later [COMPLAINANT] entered. Once both were inside the "Suite" they had sexual relations, with vaginal penetration, in its restroom.

3. From the biological report, through analysis of the buccal swab collected from [COMPLAINANT], traces of smegma matching the DNA of D.A.d.S. were detected.

4. [COMPLAINANT] had an injury to her left knee, consisting of an abrasion of 2x1 cm at the inferolateral level with three adjacent bruises, the largest 1 cm in diameter, leaving as a sequel a scar, which required only one medical visit for healing.

When the trial was held, she was on sick leave for generalized anxiety.

5. D.A. deposited the amount of 150,000 euros.

LEGAL GROUNDS

We proceed to analyze first the appeals of the prosecutions, given that the Public Prosecutor requests partial nullity of the judgment.

The appellants appeal on the following grounds:

1. Appeal of the Public Prosecutor:

1.1. Violation of legal norms, for improper application of the mitigating circumstance of reparation of damage under Art. 21.5 of the Criminal Code. Considerations on the appeal. Absence, in the judgment, of arguments that allow application of the mitigation for reparation of damage.

[PAGE 9]

1.2. Alternatively, for violation of Arts. 9.3 and 24.1 of the Spanish Constitution, which prohibit arbitrariness of public powers and guarantee effective judicial protection and error in the assessment of evidence, grounds that it treats jointly.

The appeal concludes requesting that nullity of the judgment be declared and subsequently sent to the sentencing court for correction of the noted error, and that another be issued making a correct assessment of the evidence presented at trial and observing the requirements inherent to effective judicial protection and the principle of prohibition of arbitrariness of public powers, convicting for sexual assault with penetration without mitigating circumstances, to the sentence requested by the Public Prosecutor.

2. Appeal of the Private Prosecution:

2.1. Violation of Art. 21.5 of the Criminal Code in relation to Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution.

2.2. Violation of Arts. 66 and 72 of the Criminal Code in relation to Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution. Lack of reasoning in the application of the sentence imposed. Individualization of the sentence.

The appeal concludes requesting that the judgment be partially revoked in the sense of convicting D.A.d.S. as author of a crime of sexual assault under Arts. 178 and 179 of the Criminal Code without the concurrence of circumstances modifying responsibility to the sentence of 12 years of imprisonment plus the accessories requested in the conclusions, and alternatively that he be convicted as author of the same crime, with the concurrence of the simple mitigating circumstance of reparation of damage to the sentence of 8 years of imprisonment.

3. Appeal of the Defense of D.A.d.S.

3.1. Breach of procedural norms and guarantees, under Art. 846 bis b, and 846 ter in relation to 846 of the Criminal Procedure Law, for violation of the right to defense and a process with all guarantees, which it subdivides into the following challenges: On identification of the author, violation of Art. 248 of the Criminal Procedure Law, material defenselessness. On not having access to the proceedings once the complaint was formalized and violation of the right to defense. On the denial of access to the proceedings on January 17, 2023 and on the consequence of granting the ground, through reparation of the violation of rights.

[PAGE 10]

3.2. Breach of procedural norms and guarantees, Art. 846 bis b) and 846 ter of the Criminal Procedure Law in relation to the fundamental right to defense and means of evidence, in relation to the denial of documentary evidence proposed at the preliminary matter stage; which it breaks down into improper inadmission of documentary evidence, and the consequence of granting the ground.

3.3. Breach of procedural norms and guarantees, Art. 846 bis b) and 846 ter of the Criminal Procedure Law in relation to the fundamental right to defense and means of evidence, for denial of anticipated evidence.

3.4. Breach of procedural norms and guarantees, Art. 846 bis b) and 846 ter in relation to 846 of the Criminal Procedure Law, for violation of the fundamental right to the presumption of innocence, a process with all guarantees and to an impartial judge, due to the existence of a parallel trial in the media and society with impact on the present proceedings. Which it breaks down, in its procedural aspect, through accreditation of the parallel trial and on the impact on the proceedings; and in the extra-procedural aspect in the violation of the fundamental right; as well as on the consequences of granting the ground of the injured fundamental right.

3.5. Breach of procedural norms and guarantees, Art. 846 bis b) and 846 ter in relation to 846 of the Criminal Procedure Law, for violation of the fundamental right to the presumption of innocence, a process with all guarantees and to an impartial judge and to a process with all guarantees in connection with the parallel trial.

[PAGE 11]

Breach of procedural norms and guarantees, Art. 846 bis b) and 846 ter in relation to 846 of the Criminal Procedure Law, for violation of the fundamental right to the right of defense, to an effective remedy, to effective judicial protection, and to a process with all guarantees (ex Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution) in relation to the pixelation and distortion of the complainant's voice.

3.7. Breach of procedural norms and guarantees, Art. 846 bis b) and 846 ter in relation to 846 of the Criminal Procedure Law, for violation of the right to be informed of the accusation and of the right to a process with all guarantees Art. 24.2 of the Spanish Constitution, as a crime of injuries was never charged against my client in the investigation phase, nor was he prosecuted for said crime, and alternatively prescription of the minor crime of injuries.

3.8. Breach of procedural norms and guarantees, Art. 846 bis b) and 846 ter in relation to 846 of the Criminal Procedure Law, for violation of the right to be informed of the accusation and of the right to a process with all guarantees Art. 24.2 of the Spanish Constitution, as the prosecution briefs exceeded the factual content of the indictment order.

3.10. Violation of constitutional precept for violation of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, ex Art. 846 bis b, and 846 ter in relation to Art. 790.2 of the Criminal Procedure Law (Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution) for irrational reasoning and unidirectional assessment of evidence.

3.11.

[PAGE 12]

3.12. Violation of law, ex Art. 846 bis c) letter b of the Criminal Procedure Law, for improper application of the typical element of violence ex Art. 178.2 of the Criminal Code, in relation to Art. 179 of the Criminal Code as a consequence of the violation of constitutional precept (Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution) and error iuris.

3.13. Violation of law ex Art. 846 bis c) letter b) of the Criminal Procedure Law, for improper application of error of type ex Art. 14 of the Criminal Code, formulated conditionally on the granting of the previous point (relative to the non-concurrence of violence).

Violation of constitutional precept for violation of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, ex Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution ex Art. 846 bis b) and 846 bis ter of the Criminal Procedure Law and violation of law ex Art. 846 bis c) letter b) of the Criminal Procedure Law for improper non-application of the mitigating circumstance of reparation of damage ex Art. 21.5 of the Criminal Code as highly qualified ex Art. 66.1.2 of the Criminal Code.

3.15. Violation of constitutional precept for violation of the fundamental right to effective judicial protection, ex Art. 24 of the Spanish Constitution, ex Art. 846 bis c, letter b, of the Criminal Procedure Law, for improper non-application of the mitigating circumstance of intoxication ex Art. 21.1 of the Criminal Code in relation to Art. 20.2 of the Criminal Code or Art. 21.7 of the Criminal Code in relation to 20.2 of the Criminal Code.

The appeal concludes requesting: that the appeal be granted, acquitting him of the crime of rape or alternatively that the remaining grounds be granted.

In the same brief, by way of supplementary request, it requests that evidence be taken at second instance, based on the fact that the evidence proposed at the preliminary matter stage was improperly denied, and reiterates new means of evidence. This has already been resolved in the order of this Chamber, referenced in the background.

[The document continues with extensive legal analysis. Key sections include:]

[ANALYSIS OF THE PUBLIC PROSECUTOR'S APPEAL regarding the mitigating circumstance of reparation of damage - The court explains that integration of facts favorable to the defendant is permissible even if not included in the proven facts, citing Supreme Court precedent.]

[ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE ASSESSMENT - The court conducts a thorough review of the evidentiary standards for conviction, referencing Constitutional Court and Supreme Court jurisprudence on the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof.]

[KEY FINDING ON CREDIBILITY - The court finds significant problems with the complainant's credibility:]

"We do not share the reasoning of the Trial Court. The fact of offering an account objectively discordant with reality interferes very significantly in the analysis of a witness's reliability. We must take into account that, in this case, this account is not the result of an impulse or a moment of confusion. The complainant has consistently maintained this version (until the moment of the oral trial) that does not correspond to reality even knowing, through her legal counsel, the existence of the recording and its content."

[ON CORROBORATION - The court finds insufficient corroboration:]

"In conclusion, the declaration that there was non-consensual vaginal penetration lacks peripheral corroboration, and the elements considered do not accredit it; there is only her statement."

[ON THE STANDARD OF PROOF - The court applies the in dubio pro reo principle:]

"What we affirm is that, from the evidence presented, it cannot be concluded that the standards required by the presumption of innocence have been met in accordance with Art. 24.2 of the Spanish Constitution and Art. 6 of Directive (EU) 2016/343 of the European Parliament and Council of March 9, 2016 'Strengthening certain aspects of the presumption of innocence and the right to be present at trial in criminal proceedings,' which expressly establishes: '1. Member States shall ensure that the burden of proof for establishing the guilt of suspects and accused persons rests on the prosecution. 2. Member States shall ensure that any doubt as to the guilt always benefits the suspect or accused person, including when the court assesses whether the person concerned should be acquitted.'"

RULING

In light of the above, WE RULE:

1. Not to grant the appeals filed by the Public Prosecutor and by the Private Prosecution against the judgment of February 22, 2024 of the Barcelona Provincial Court (Twenty-First Section).

2. To grant the appeal filed by the legal representation of [D.A.d.S.]. We fully revoke the judgment issued at first instance.

We must acquit and we DO ACQUIT [D.A.d.S.] of the crime of sexual assault of which he was being accused. The precautionary measures adopted are set aside.

We declare the procedural costs of this second instance to be paid ex officio.

Notify this resolution to the parties present, informing them that an appeal in cassation may be filed before the Second Chamber of the Supreme Court in the terms provided in Art. 847 of the Criminal Procedure Law.

This is our judgment which we sign and order.

PUBLICATION. The above Judgment was read, signed, and published on the same day as its date. I certify.
