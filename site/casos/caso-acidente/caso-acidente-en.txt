TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE __ CIVIL COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF FORTALEZA - CEARA

PEDRO BATISTA, Brazilian citizen, (marital status), (profession), holder of Taxpayer ID No. (xxx), residing at (full address), through his undersigned attorney (power of attorney attached), respectfully appears before Your Honor, pursuant to Articles 186 and 927 of the Civil Code, to file the present

COMPLAINT FOR PROPERTY DAMAGES

Against JOAO VIGARIO, Brazilian citizen, (marital status), (profession), holder of Taxpayer ID No. (xxx), residing at (full address), based on the following facts and legal grounds:

I - STATEMENT OF FACTS

The Plaintiff is the lawful owner of a white Volkswagen Beetle, license plate XXX-0000, year 20XX.

On July 1, 2024, at approximately 2:00 PM, the Plaintiff's vehicle was parked at 199 Diretoria Street, Fortaleza/CE, when it was struck from behind by a blue Fiat, license plate ZZZ-9999, owned by the Defendant, which collided with the rear fender of the Plaintiff's Beetle.

The Defendant failed to exercise the necessary care while driving his vehicle, rear-ending the Plaintiff's automobile even though it was properly parked at the location.

II - PROPERTY DAMAGES

As a direct and immediate consequence of the collision caused exclusively by the Defendant, the Plaintiff's vehicle sustained damage to the rear fender, as shown in the attached photographs, estimated at R$ 100.00 (one hundred reais), which amount must be reimbursed by the Defendant.

III - LEGAL BASIS

The Plaintiff's right to compensation for the material damages suffered is grounded in Articles 186 and 927 of the Civil Code, which establish that anyone who causes damage to another, whether through voluntary action or omission, negligence, or recklessness, is obligated to repair it.

In the present case, the damages sustained by the Plaintiff resulted solely and exclusively from the negligent and reckless conduct of the Defendant, who failed to observe the necessary care while driving his vehicle, colliding with the Plaintiff's automobile, which was stationary at the accident site.

The Plaintiff's right to compensation for the material damages suffered is grounded in Articles 186 and 927 of the Civil Code. Article 186 of the Civil Code provides that "anyone who, by voluntary action or omission, negligence, or recklessness, violates a right and causes damage to another, even if exclusively moral damage, commits a tortious act." Article 927 of the same statute establishes that "anyone who, by tortious act, causes damage to another, is obligated to repair it."

Civil liability is therefore based on the occurrence of a tortious act resulting in damage to another person, whether through action or omission, intentional or negligent conduct. Negligent conduct, characterized by carelessness, recklessness, or lack of skill, is sufficient to establish the obligation to compensate.

In the present case, the damages sustained by the Plaintiff resulted solely and exclusively from the negligent and reckless conduct of the Defendant. The Defendant, while driving his vehicle, failed to observe the necessary care, colliding with the Plaintiff's automobile, which was properly parked on the public roadway in compliance with applicable traffic regulations.

Regarding the Defendant's Negligence and Recklessness

Negligence is characterized by the failure to exercise the care that a reasonable and prudent person would exercise while driving a vehicle, while recklessness refers to careless or hasty action. In the present case, the Defendant failed to act with the necessary diligence while traveling on Diretoria Street, No. 199, in Fortaleza/CE, rear-ending the Plaintiff's vehicle, which was properly parked.

The collision occurred on July 1, 2024, at approximately 2:00 PM, when the Plaintiff's vehicle was parked. The Defendant, by failing to maintain a safe distance and by not paying attention to traffic conditions and the presence of the Plaintiff's vehicle, acted recklessly and negligently, resulting in the collision and consequent damage to the Plaintiff's vehicle.

Regarding the Exclusive Fault of the Defendant

It should be emphasized that the Plaintiff's vehicle was properly parked, and there was no contributory conduct to the accident. Liability for the incident falls entirely on the Defendant, who, by failing to adopt proper precautions while driving, violated traffic regulations and caused the material damages claimed herein.

The material damages suffered by the Plaintiff have been duly assessed and are estimated at R$ 100.00 (one hundred reais), as evidenced by the documents and photographs attached to this complaint. This amount represents the cost of repairing the rear fender of the Volkswagen Beetle owned by the Plaintiff, damaged exclusively by the Defendant's conduct.

Regarding the Obligation to Compensate

As established in Articles 186 and 927 of the Civil Code, the obligation to compensate is unavoidable upon proof of the tortious act, the damage, and the causal connection between the Defendant's conduct and the losses suffered by the Plaintiff. In the present case, all these requirements are amply demonstrated, thus establishing the Plaintiff's right to compensation for the material damages caused to him.

Therefore, it is clear that the Defendant must be ordered to compensate the Plaintiff for the amount of material damages, with monetary correction and legal interest from the date of the harmful event, as requested in this complaint.

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE __ CIVIL COURT OF THE DISTRICT OF FORTALEZA - CEARA

Case No.: (case number)

JOAO VIGARIO, already identified in the case records, through his undersigned attorney (power of attorney attached), respectfully appears before Your Honor to file his

ANSWER TO COMPLAINT

To the Complaint for Property Damages filed by PEDRO BATISTA, based on the following facts and legal grounds:

I - CHALLENGE TO THE FACTS ALLEGED IN THE COMPLAINT

Contrary to what is alleged in the complaint, the accident involving the Plaintiff and the Defendant DID NOT occur at 199 Diretoria Street, but rather at 111 Clemencia Street.

Furthermore, the date and time of the accident also do not correspond to reality. The event occurred on July 4, 2024, at approximately 10:00 PM, and not on July 1, 2024, at 2:00 PM as stated by the Plaintiff.

Moreover, the dynamics of the accident as described in the complaint are inaccurate. What actually occurred was that the Plaintiff, while performing a reverse maneuver on the street, ended up striking the rear of his Black Beetle against the Defendant's automobile, which was not a blue Fiat as alleged, but rather a red Ferrari.

Thus, it is clear that the version of events presented by the Plaintiff should not prevail, as it does not correspond to reality and should be disregarded by this Court.

II - NEED FOR PRODUCTION OF EVIDENCE

Considering the discrepancies noted above regarding the facts alleged in the complaint, it is essential that evidence be produced during the discovery phase of the proceedings.

Therefore, the Defendant requests that the competent police authority be directed to submit to this Court a copy of the Police Report filed at the time of the accident, and that the Plaintiff be required to present photographs of his Ferrari vehicle involved in the collision, in order to verify the truthfulness of the allegations in this Defense.

III - RELIEF REQUESTED

In light of the foregoing, the Defendant respectfully requests:

a) That this Answer be received and processed, as it is timely filed;
b) That the police authority be directed to submit a copy of the Police Report;
c) That the Plaintiff be ordered to present photographs of his Ferrari vehicle;
d) That, after proper discovery, the action be dismissed in its entirety, with the Plaintiff ordered to pay costs and attorney's fees.

Respectfully submitted.

Fortaleza, (date).

Introduction
Civil liability in the field of automobile accidents has gained increased importance given the growth of the automotive industry sectors, combined with the urgent demand for increasingly safe, efficient, and low-cost means of transportation.
These are passenger cars, vans, buses, motorcycles, that crowd city avenues and circulate among pedestrians, motorcyclists, traffic lights, and obstacles. Not only must the driver coordinate the quantity of information while driving his vehicle in heavy traffic, but he must also deal with poor road conditions, without adequate traffic planning, which generates the most varied and complex legal situations.
For these reasons, the number of traffic accidents, both on highways and in medium and large cities, is alarming.
Wilson Melo da Silva (1983, p. 11) lists the main causes of traffic accidents in a singular manner:
[...] the lack of psychological adjustment for driving the vehicle and the customary disobedience to rules and regulatory provisions. And he adds that such causes, in the generality with which they are presented, allow for developments: intoxication, fatigue, sleepiness, nervousness, states of depression and anguish, emulation, drug use, exhibitionism, etc.
All these causes and developments evidence negligent conduct by the driver and demonstrate the need for more severe penalties to be imposed on accident causers.
As the utility of automobiles has surpassed the need for locomotion, their loss or deterioration generates significant economic loss to the owner's assets, since these durable goods today carry an evident commercial character, sometimes sentimental, and often are a symbol of status.
Besides the material representativeness of the property, other values are at stake, such as life, moral, physical, and aesthetic integrity of the accident victim, as well as the productivity and work capacity of the person, which implies family sustainability.
When a car accident occurs, some figures may be present: employer and employee, father and son, owner and driver, interested or uninterested third parties, insurer and insured, lessor and lessee, etc., who are connected by the bond of fault, in the most frequent cases.
Often, proof of fault is dispensed with, requiring only the causal link between the person and the damage for the liability to compensate to arise. There are several modalities or different ways of attributing to someone the duty to pay, whether through the commission of a tort (tort liability: art. 186 of the Civil Code), through a contract binding the parties (contractual liability), through the power of command or representation (art. 115 of the Civil Code), or through parental authority, guardianship, or curatorship (art. 932, I and II of the Civil Code).
One can cite subjective liability (arising from fault) and objective liability (such as State liability, governed by art. 37, paragraph 6 of the Federal Constitution), or liability for the act of an employee or agent (art. 932, III, and 933 of the Civil Code).
Jose de Aguiar Dias (1979, p. 28) and Caio Mario (1992, p. 122) also teach that Brazilian doctrine regarding automobile liability followed French law (Napoleonic Code, art. 1,384, paragraph 2), and takes fault linked to "custody of the thing" as its basis. This establishes the obligation to answer for the acts of persons and things, although a system has been built with foundations in case law, since it is up to the courts to extract from the fundamental precepts the pronouncement that is, at the time, the most apt to achieve the purpose of law.

Semina: Social Sciences and Humanities, Londrina, v. 29, n. 1, p. 61-74, Jan./Jun. 2008
Civil liability in automobile traffic accidents - relevant aspects of legislation, doctrine, and case law
Our Code adopted the principle of fault as the basis for liability, although there are concessions to objective liability, which will be discussed later.
Jose de Aguiar Dias (1979, p. 122) describes fault as a "situation contrary to the state of grace, which, in theological language, is attributed to the soul free from sin."
Two modalities of fault are found, namely: contractual and extra-contractual or aquilian (tort). Both are based on the concept of fault, although the rules that the law establishes in matters of contractual fault may be applied to extra-contractual, and vice versa.
In traffic accidents, in general, both contractual liability (e.g., transportation relationship, insurance, between employer and employee) and extra-contractual liability (relationship between driver and victim, between driver and passenger) are sometimes present.
Fault designates the violation of a pre-existing precept or duty. Fault is also verified in the practice of unlawful conduct that was foreseeable and avoidable.
In short, when the unlawful act affects the material or immaterial assets of another, civil liability is established.
Theories of Fault
Theory of Subjective Fault
Being liable for damage if one has been its direct cause is the definition of fault, as a rule, adopted by the Brazilian Civil Code.
The Civil Code, in its Article 927, caput, states: "Anyone who, by unlawful act (arts. 186 and 187), causes damage to another, is obligated to repair it." (BRAZIL, 2007, p. 252).
This means that, once the existence of fault is verified, the duty to compensate is generated on the part of the causing agent, but there must be a causal link between his conduct and the damage produced.
Therefore, fault may characterize negligence (omission), recklessness (action), and lack of skill (irregular conduct at work). All must be proven for the defendant to be held liable for the damage, as well as the link between the conduct and the damage.
Theory of Objective Fault or Risk Theory
The Civil Code enshrined the risk theory in its Article 927, sole paragraph, in fine:
There shall be an obligation to repair the damage, regardless of fault, in cases specified by law, or when the activity normally developed by the author of the damage implies, by its nature, risk to the rights of others (BRAZIL, 2007, p. 252).
Saleilles (apud DIAS, 1979, p. 63) brilliantly explains the foundations for applying this theory:
The law leaves each person free to act; it only prohibits those acts that are known to be the direct cause of damage. It could not prohibit those that only carry the potential for harmful acts, since one may fundamentally believe that such dangers can be avoided with prudence and skill. But, if the law permits them, it imposes on those who take the risk upon themselves the obligation to pay the respective expenses, whether or not they result from fault. Between them and the victims there is no equality. Once the damage has occurred, someone must bear it. There is no positive fault on either side. What, then, would be the criterion for imputing risk? Practice demands that whoever obtains profit from an initiative bear its burdens, at least by virtue of its material cause, since this initiative constitutes a fact that, in itself and by itself, contains potential dangers against which third parties have no effective defense. It is a balancing act. Justice requires that the scale of liability tip toward the initiator of the risk.
In objective theory, there is no need to prove fault. However, there is still action or omission
64
Azevedo, A. P. de
Semina: Social Sciences and Humanities, Londrina, v. 29, n. 1, p. 61-74, Jan./Jun. 2008
on the part of the causing agent, the damage (loss), and the causal link.
Articles 932 and 933 of the Civil Code mentioned certain persons, such as parents, teachers, employers, and those responsible for custody, who are presumed at fault once the harmful event occurs. The presumption is absolute.
It means that none of these persons is allowed to offer proof that they did not commit a negligent act; their proof is restricted to the grounds for excluding liability: exclusive fault of the victim, fortuitous event, and force majeure.
This is because, in these cases, there is a presumption and fault is deemed proven. The victim only has to demonstrate that the damage was caused by the person or thing under the defendant's custody.
On the other hand, the defendant can only produce evidence of force majeure or victim's fault in order to excuse himself from liability for the damage.
However, there is a ruling from the Superior Court of Justice to the effect that "the owner of the vehicle is released from liability for the damage if he proves that he did everything to prevent the occurrence of the event." (BRAZIL, 2000).
When objective liability is present, the term "comparative fault" is not applicable, since for one of the parties there is no analysis of fault. What exists is solely the victim's fault, whether total or partial, for the harmful act, minimizing or excluding objective liability, which will influence the quantum of compensation.
The risk theory also applies to the State, by constitutional provision, in its Article 107. The public entity is charged with ensuring the safety of the traffic system, as well as the maintenance of roads, and is liable for poor signage and potholes, for example. But it may still be mitigated if it demonstrates that the injured party also contributed with fault to the event.
It is interesting to note the evolution of the institution of liability without fault, in which not only the unlawful or abnormal act came to generate a right to compensation, but any act, purely and simply, provided that it injured another. The risk of the activity is assumed by its beneficiary. If the benefit accrues to him, in equal measure, so does the burden, regardless of verification of negligence, recklessness, or lack of skill in the acts committed.
Thus, one sees the elimination of tort liability in favor of contractual liability, which benefits the production of evidence by the victim.
Now, if there is a contract that binds the causer of the damage to the legally responsible party, the latter, who may be the employer, the carrier, the State, will be liable regardless of proof of fault.
Including the causer of the damage in the defendant's position is therefore the victim's option.
Such a legal situation is seen in the passenger/carrier relationship, for example. Here, the carrier assumes the obligation to transport the passenger safely. If it fails to do so, it is in breach of the contract and is obligated to compensate.
Case law makes an exception to subjective liability in the case of carriers, in the sense that:
A cause for exclusion of the transportation company's liability constitutes a fact entirely unrelated to the transportation itself, such as a robbery occurring inside the vehicle (BRAZIL, 2002).
However, there will always be a right of recourse against the causer of the damage, if the latter acted with intent or fault (arts. 735 and 934 of the Civil Code).
The insurer also has a right of recourse against the causer of the damage for what it actually paid, up to the limit provided in the insurance contract. (BRAZIL, STF).
65
Semina: Social Sciences and Humanities, Londrina, v. 29, n. 1, p. 61-74, Jan./Jun. 2008
Civil liability in automobile traffic accidents - relevant aspects of legislation, doctrine, and case law
Thus, in the action brought by the victim solely against the objectively liable party, the latter may proceed with third-party notice against whoever is obligated, by law or contract, to indemnify, in a right of recourse, the loss of whoever loses the lawsuit (art. 70, III, of the Code of Civil Procedure), avoiding the filing of a separate action.
This is a case of mandatory third-party notice. However, case law is divided as to the consequences of failure to give third-party notice. One current holds that the party who did not give third-party notice will only be without an enforcement title, without prejudice to filing an action against the responsible party (BRAZIL, 1999); another holds that, in the absence of third-party notice, the losing party loses the right of recourse, but this is a minority view.
The first current prevails and, with respect to the State, there is settled case law from the Superior Court of Justice (BRAZIL, 2005).
The judgment that finds the action meritorious will declare, as the case may be, the right of the evicted party, or liability for losses and damages, and will serve as an enforcement title (art. 76, Code of Civil Procedure).
A current question is whether the victim can file a direct action against the insurer, that is, against whoever is obligated to indemnify in a recourse action.
There are two contrary positions within the Superior Court of Justice:
a. one understanding the possibility of direct action against the insurer, it being irrelevant that the contract involves only the insured who caused the accident, who refuses to use the insurance coverage (BRAZIL, 2000). In this case, the insurer will bear court costs and attorney's fees, in case of loss.
b. another understanding that the civil liability action must be brought against the party responsible for the damage, who must give third-party notice to the third party obligated to indemnify the loss (BRAZIL, 1997), since the insurance contract provides for reimbursement to the insured for what was spent and not direct payment to a third party foreign to the contract. Once third-party notice is accepted, the third party does not bear the costs of loss (BRAZIL, 2000). If the insurer's obligation does not cover the entire claim, it may refuse the third-party notice in this part.
Even in direct action against the insurer, there is a need to prove the insured's fault (BRAZIL, 2000), because the insurer is only obligated when the reimbursement situation is present. Thus, either the causer of the damage must be joined in the defendant's position, or will be called as a witness, so that the insured's fault is established and, theoretically, the insurer's obligation to reimburse him.
The Court has understood the possibility of joint judgment against the insured and insurer, thus defeating the argument that the insurer has only a duty of reimbursement (BRAZIL, 2000).
It is important to note that Precedent 246 of the Superior Court of Justice states that "the value of mandatory insurance must be deducted from the judicially fixed compensation."
Theory of Fault Against Legality
Rui Stoco (2004, p. 1376) warns of the expansion of the application of this theory, adopted by authors such as Martinho Garcez Neto and Wilson Melo da Silva. According to it, disrespect for a traffic regulatory norm presupposes the agent's fault, without the need to demonstrate recklessness or negligence. Thus, if the driver was above the permitted speed at the location at the time of the accident, was intoxicated, without a driver's license, or talking on a cell phone, for example, his fault would be established, which would lead him to compensate for the resulting damages.

Azevedo, A. P. de
Semina: Social Sciences and Humanities, Londrina, v. 29, n. 1, p. 61-74, Jan./Jun. 2008
Damages Arising from Traffic Accidents and Their Implications
The amount of compensation, as a rule, is measured by the severity of the damage, which can range from a minor injury to loss or disability of a limb or death.
In these cases, the judge analyzes the degree of harm and the financial capacity of the offender. Case law has ordered compensation of 100 to 200 minimum wages in cases of death, for moral damages, in addition to any lost profits, pension, and property damages, such as hospital and funeral expenses (art. 948 of the Civil Code).
There can be no liability without the existence of actual damage: injury to any legal asset. Thus, hypothetical damage does not justify compensation. As a rule, the injured party must prove the damage, and indications of possible loss are not enough. The loss must be certain - this is the essential rule of reparation.
Positive damage (actual damages) and frustrated profit (lost profits) find support for reparation, where mere possibility is not enough, but absolute certainty is also not required.
The correct criterion is to condition lost profits to an objective probability resulting from the normal development of events (STOCO, 2004, p. 935).
Article 5 of the Federal Constitution of 1988 ensures the right to compensation for property damage, moral damage, and damage to image, which aims, if possible, to restore the status quo ante, that is, returning to the state it was in before the occurrence of the unlawful act.
Reparation may be natural, which involves restoration of the altered status quo, but monetary compensation, despite its subsidiary character, is the most frequent.
Once the compensation amount is fixed, the judge must also fix interest and monetary correction in the judgment, which follows a settled case law criterion.
According to Precedent 54 of the STJ, "default interest runs from the date of the harmful event, in cases of extra-contractual liability," applying default interest of 0.5% (half percent) per month for the period preceding the effectiveness of the new Civil Code and, from January 11, 2003, the rate of 1% (one percent) per month applies.
Note that case law made an exception to the application of Articles 405 of the Civil Code and 219, caput, of the Code of Civil Procedure, for cases of extra-contractual liability, so that interest does not run from service of the complaint, but from the date of the harmful event.
With respect to monetary correction, Precedent 43 of the STJ states: "monetary correction applies to debt for unlawful act from the date of actual loss."
Since monetary correction has the objective of maintaining the purchasing power of the currency over time, its application is not from the date of the decision, but rather, in the case of property damages, from the date of the actual loss caused to the plaintiff, that is, on the day of the automobile accident.
When dealing with moral damages, this will run from the date of the judgment.
If each litigant is partly successful and partly unsuccessful, the costs of loss must be borne proportionally among the litigants (art. 21, CPC).
It is important to note that the Civil Code brought an innovative article, without correspondence with the 1916 Code, which gives a differentiated approach to compensation for damages, taking into account the degree of fault for equitable reduction of compensation. The sole paragraph of Article 944 reads as follows:
"Art. 944. Compensation is measured by the extent of the damage."
"Sole paragraph. If there is excessive disproportion between the gravity of the fault and the damage, the judge may equitably reduce the compensation."

Semina: Social Sciences and Humanities, Londrina, v. 29, n. 1, p. 61-74, Jan./Jun. 2008
Civil liability in automobile traffic accidents - relevant aspects of legislation, doctrine, and case law
Thus, when there is disproportion between the gravity of the fault (e.g., slight fault consisting of driving without attention or without the care essential to safety - art. 169 of the Brazilian Traffic Code - CTB) and the damage (e.g., death), the judge may take into account not the gravity of the damage, but the degree of fault to measure compensation.
Property Damage
Property damage refers to the economic loss to the injured party's assets, which must be viewed from current and future perspectives.
Compensation, viewed from the current perspective, includes expenses for medications, hospital, transportation, funeral, etc., as well as what the victim failed to earn (lost profits). Once these expenses are proven, the duty to compensate is certain, which dispenses with further analysis.
The future perspective is embodied in what the victim or dependents will cease to earn due to permanent or temporary loss of the injured party's work capacity. One can speak of a pension, lifetime or for a determined period (art. 950, caput, CC), or lump sum compensation (art. 950, sole paragraph, CC), depending on the degree of injury or death, which requires a more detailed study of its particularities.
Once the financial dependence of the plaintiffs on the victim is proven, the payment of a monthly pension is required. The monthly pension is due from the date of the occurrence of the harmful event.
As for the end date of the pension, if parents die, with respect to children, cessation of support is presumed at age 25, on the assumption that, at this age, they would have independent lives.
If, in the same accident, one of the parents and the child died, at the time when this child would have turned 25, the pension in his favor reverts to the widower, minus 1/3, referring to the victim's personal expenses. This is because it is understood that with the child's economic independence from the parents, the amount spent on his subsistence would revert to the benefit of the other dependents.
In other cases, given the current life expectancy of Brazilians, the pension varies in case law until the date when the victim would have turned 65 or 70 years of age.
In the case of a lifetime pension, from the calculated compensation must be deducted the usual portion corresponding to 1/3, which would constitute the minimum expense necessary for the deceased's survival.
Moral Damage and Aesthetic Damage
In fixing moral damages, the judge must take into account criteria of proportionality and reasonableness, considering the conditions of the offender, the offended party, and the legal interest injured, and it cannot constitute a source of unjust enrichment nor represent an insignificant amount that does not serve as a deterrent to the agent.
Doctrine and case law point to the fact that personal damage is contained in moral damage. In this sense, was the understanding of Justice Fernando Goncalves, emphasizing that it is settled understanding of the Superior Court of Justice - STJ: "personal damage comprises moral damage" (BRAZIL, 2003), thus, it is that which affects a personality right, whether physical, somatic, or psychic, of a patrimonial or extra-patrimonial nature.
Aesthetic damage is embodied in the fact that the victim has experienced morphological deformity, which is aggravated if she depended economically on her appearance.
With regard to the cumulation of aesthetic damage with moral damage, case law is divided, part understanding that aesthetic damage is a modality of moral damage, part asserting that each damage is subject to differentiated compensation.

On this particular point, the STJ has maintained that aesthetic damage is individualized from moral damage, if it is possible to quantify the values autonomously (BRAZIL, 2007).
Note that the Superior Court of Justice admitted the existence of aesthetic damage and moral damage as different concepts and, conversely, admitted them cumulatively.
This means that the doctrinal discussion does not affect the actual compensation for the intensity of the damage, whether understood as moral or aesthetic. It is up to the judge to understand aesthetic damage, in itself considered, as a modality or not of moral damage.
The substance is to assess the extent of the damage and compensate to an equivalent degree.
Should the judge understand that aesthetic damage is contained in moral damage, or even that there is no aesthetic damage, but only moral damage, its compensation, however, does not necessarily always mean the exhaustion of the amount deemed due. In this case, moral damage must be compensated taking into account the intensity of pain and loss.
Thus, both manifestations are compensable. The care is not to lead the cumulation to a bis in idem, unbearable to the compensator. This would be to attribute to moral damage a double compensatory burden: one referring to what may be called pure moral damage and another for morphological damage, and still burden the offender with compensation for damage understood as purely aesthetic.
Professor Clayton Reis (2000, p. 113-114), in his work Assessment of Moral Damage, brings a comparative table between the average values (in minimum wages) fixed by Brazilian Courts and the damage experienced by the victim, resulting in a true equation for calculating moral damage; however, case law is inconsistent.
Grounds for Mitigation or Exclusion of Liability to Compensate
Comparative Fault
It consists of the fact that both plaintiff and victim have contributed, each with their share of fault, to the occurrence of the harmful event.
Article 945, which has no correspondence in the 1916 Civil Code, states:
Art. 945. If the victim has negligently contributed to the harmful event, her compensation shall be fixed taking into account the gravity of her fault in comparison with that of the author of the damage.
Here the legislator adopted a balanced criterion for assessing the quantum of compensation, taking as a basis the participation of plaintiff and victim in the dynamics of the accident. This dispels the idea of the duality of guilty and innocent in judging the case, advocating the reality of the facts.
Some scholars call this institute the theory of adequate causation.
If, even after discovery, there is still doubt as to the offended party's participation or not in the event that caused him loss, the principle in dubio pro creditoris prevails, where the judge's attention must turn to the victim, even at the risk that the offender compensates more than was due. This is because protection of the person is a fundamental constitutional guarantee and takes priority over the right not to compensate, so that the victim is not allowed to receive less.
Regarding the transportation of persons, along the same lines, the legislator provides in Article 738, sole paragraph, of the Civil Code, in fine:
Sole paragraph. If the loss suffered by the transported person is attributable to transgression of regulatory norms and instructions, the judge shall equitably reduce the compensation to the extent that the

Civil liability in automobile traffic accidents - relevant aspects of legislation, doctrine, and case law
victim has contributed to the occurrence of the damage.
This is, therefore, comparative fault, a ground for reducing liability to compensate, which depends on evidentiary proceedings by each party regarding the causal link. It cannot, therefore, be alleged against objective liability.
Exclusive Fault of the Victim
In cases of exclusive fault of the victim, Silvio Rodrigues (1997, p. 165-166) teaches:
Indeed, in the case of exclusive fault of the victim, the agent who directly causes the damage is merely an instrument of the accident, and one cannot really speak of a causal link between his act and the loss experienced by her.
The victim's conduct as the generating fact of the damage eliminates causation. Indeed, if the victim contributed with an act of her own in the construction of the elements of the damage, the law cannot remain indifferent to this circumstance. Indeed, it is a ground for exclusion of liability, to be alleged and proven even in cases of objective liability.
Rui Stoco warns of the principle of trust that prevails in traffic matters, exemplifying (2001, p. 1122):
In traffic matters, the principle of trust must always prevail. The driver of a vehicle has the right to expect that other drivers and pedestrians will comply with traffic rules and the precautions required of everyone in social coexistence. If the pedestrian fails to observe the rules concerning normal conduct, attempting to cross the roadway outside the safety crossings, there is no way to impute fault to the driver of the vehicle, who is surprised by the unforeseeable behavior of the pedestrian, in the case of the latter being run over.
But this situation differs from fortuitous event, force majeure, and even the act of a third party.
Fortuitous Event, Force Majeure, and Act of Third Party
Fortuitous event and force majeure are grounds for exclusion of liability by elimination of the causal link.
This means that the author of the harmful action will not be liable to the victim in any way, neither through a direct action brought against him, nor through recourse action, even when objective liability is present.
Indeed, one derived from a contract with a carrier (art. 734 of the CC), since the effects of the event that occurred were not possible to avoid (art. 393 of the CC).
The act of a third party corresponds to an injury occurring through the fault of an identified third person, other than those involved in the accident.
In this case, although there is also exclusion of the causal link, Article 930 of the CC determines that the agent of the conduct (author of the damage) is liable for the loss, who, however, will have a right of recourse to recover the amount he has compensated the injured party. Similarly, when there is contractual liability of a carrier (art. 735 of the CC), who will pay for the damages and have a right of recourse.
Civil Incapacity of the Causer of the Damage
The Civil Code deals with the question of liability of the incapacitated person in the following Articles 928 and 934, in fine:
Article 928. The incapacitated person is liable for the losses he causes, if the persons responsible for him have no obligation to do so or do not have sufficient means.
70
Azevedo, A. P. de
Semina: Social Sciences and Humanities, Londrina, v. 29, n. 1, p. 61-74, Jan./Jun. 2008
Sole paragraph. The compensation provided for in this article, which must be equitable, shall not take place if it deprives the incapacitated person or persons dependent on him of what is necessary.
Article 934. Whoever compensates for damage caused by another may recover what he has paid from the person for whom he paid, except if the causer of the damage is his descendant, absolutely or relatively incapacitated.
An innovation is noted regarding the liability of the incapacitated person himself for damages caused to third parties, expanding the list of civilly liable persons.
Also liable for civil reparation are: parents, for minor children (children or adolescents) who are under their authority and in their company; and tutors and curators, for their wards and persons under their curatorship, who are in the same conditions.
The only hypothesis in which there may be joint liability of the minor under 18 with his parents is if he has been emancipated under the terms of art. 5, sole paragraph, item I, of the new Civil Code. (NEGRAO; GOUVEA, 2007a or b??, p. 255).
The incapacitated person becomes liable with his own assets for the losses he causes, if the persons responsible for him have no obligation to do so or do not have sufficient means. Compensation, in these cases, must be equitable and shall not take place if it deprives the incapacitated person or persons dependent on him of what is necessary.
The impossibility of depriving the person of what is necessary, provided for in art. 928, translates a duty of equitable compensation, informed by the constitutional principle of protection of human dignity. As a consequence, also parents, tutors, and curators will be benefited by the humanitarian limit of the duty to compensate, so that the passage to the incapacitated person's assets will occur not when all the responsible party's resources are exhausted, but if they are reduced to the amount necessary to maintain his dignity. (NEGRAO; GOUVEA, 2007a, p. 255).
The incapacitated person is liable for the losses he causes in a subsidiary manner, because, a priori, the obligation falls on the responsible party, who is liable regardless of fault (art. 933 of the CC), unless the latter has no obligation to do so.
It is seen that it constitutes a differentiated modality of the application of risk theory.
The legal guardian is released from such obligation when he proves any of the grounds for excluding liability, because they break the causal link even for cases of application of objective theory.
Civil Liability and the Brazilian Traffic Code - Law 9,503, of September 23, 1997.
As a result of the number of assets to be protected as a result of a traffic accident, the law needed to encompass these new situations and provide normative support for pre-existing law.
Fortunately, after thirty-one years of effectiveness, the old National Traffic Code (Law 5,108, of September 21, 1966) was replaced by the current Brazilian Traffic Code (Law 9,503, of September 23, 1997), which brought numerous modifications and innovations, including a chapter dedicated exclusively to traffic offenses (STOCO, 2004, p. 1374).
The rules governing traffic of any nature on land routes in the national territory are governed by the Brazilian Traffic Code (Law 9,503, of September 23, 1997), which came into force on January 22, 1998.
The administrative and criminal liability of the driver is contained in this Traffic Code.
Administrative infractions are provided for in arts. 161 to 255 and the penalties for infraction of the rules established for the circulation of motor vehicles are found in arts. 256 to 268. Traffic crimes are found in arts. 291 to 312.
The most significant modifications introduced

Civil liability in automobile traffic accidents - relevant aspects of legislation, doctrine, and case law
by the CTB occurred in the criminal area and were severely criticized by Doctrine, since they presented a disastrous incongruity with the provisions of the current Penal Code, with respect to the classification of the crime and penalty.
On the other hand, the criminal part of the code was concerned with the reparation of civil damage, making the settlement provided for in the Special Criminal Courts law a form of extinction of punishability in some traffic crimes, such as, for example, negligent bodily injury and driving under the influence (art. 291 of the CTB), classifying them as offenses of minor offensive potential.
The civil settlement of Article 74 of Law 9,099/95, approved by the Court, has the force of an enforcement title, to be enforced by the Public Prosecutor's Office.
If there is no settlement between plaintiff and victim, the Public Prosecutor's Office may offer a plea bargain, when the requirements of art. 76, paragraph 2, of Law 9,099/95 are met, which provides for the application of a fine, the value of which reverts in favor of the victim (art. 297, caput, of the CTB).
In these cases, the settlement of property damage will be expedited, with enormous advantage, since the fine may be of a value less than or equal to the property loss experienced, but in any case, will be discounted in the Civil Action sought by the victim, which may not even exist.
The calculation of the fine is based on paragraph 1 of Article 49 of the Penal Code, as provided in Article 297 of the CTB, and the ceiling limit is 306 daily fines or R$ 324,000.00.
Thus, the fine acquired a dual nature: criminal penalty and civil sanction.
If at the conciliation hearing: 1) there is no civil settlement (compensatory agreement for property damage between the parties), 2) the defendant does not accept the plea bargain proposed by the Public Prosecutor's Office, or 3) cannot avail himself of it (requirements of Article 76, paragraph 2, of Law 9,099/95), the defendant will still be subject to the application of a fine, alone or concurrently with the restrictive penalty of liberty, when the crime so provides.
This fine provided for in the criminal offense will also be reverted in favor of the victim. For example: in the crime of Article 305 (fleeing the accident scene) the fine is alternative ("or") with the restrictive penalty of liberty, but in the crime of the following Article, 306 (intoxication), the fine is concurrent ("and").
Thus, the victim will hardly see a criminal proceeding concluded without any reparation, because only in Articles 302 (negligent homicide) and 303 (negligent bodily injury) did the legislator not provide for the application of a fine and, by the maximum penalty (3 and 2 years respectively), Article 76 of Law 9,099/95 does not apply, that is, civil and criminal settlement.
With regard to the crime of bodily injury, an incongruity with the corresponding articles in the Penal Code and CTB is seen.
This is because the crime of negligent injury of Article 129, paragraph 6, of the PC, regardless of the severity of the injury, has a maximum penalty of one year, that is, it falls within the list of crimes of minor offensive potential, which provides for the application of civil and criminal settlement.
The Brazilian Traffic Code, in its Article 303, for the same crime of negligent injury, now in driving a motor vehicle, provides for a maximum penalty of 2 years, a period that exceeds the limit established by Law 9,099/95, which prevents civil compensation by the defendant in criminal court to the victim.
In this case, the Superior Court of Justice, until 2001, applied Law 9,099/95 (see RHC 10872), the law more beneficial to the defendant. With the advent of the Federal Special Court Law, which raised the maximum penalty to 2 years, the STJ began to apply the benefits of the court to state crimes with this maximum penalty, in accordance with the principle of equality (see RESP. 610328, RESP. 610323, and HC 25901).
In short, only when there is no agreement or in the cases of Articles 302 (negligent homicide) and 303
72
Azevedo, A. P. de

(negligent bodily injury) of the CTB must the injured party necessarily file the appropriate compensatory action in civil court, because there will be no such possibility in criminal court.
For these cases, civil legislation remains for assessing the quantum of compensation.
In the case of homicide, the Civil Code establishes:
"Art. 948. In the case of homicide, compensation consists, without excluding other reparations:
I - in payment of expenses for treatment of the victim, funeral, and mourning of the family;
II - in providing support to persons to whom the deceased owed it, taking into account the probable duration of the victim's life."
Bodily injury also finds specific provision:
"Art. 949. In the case of injury or other offense to health, the offender shall compensate the offended party for treatment expenses and lost profits until the end of convalescence, in addition to any other loss that the offended party proves to have suffered."
Note that civil liability is independent of criminal liability except in the hypotheses provided for in art. 935 of the Civil Code, when there is discussion about the existence of the fact or who its author is. The master Jose de Aguiar Dias teaches that:
Civil reparation actually reintegrates the injured party to the prior property situation (at least as much as possible, given the fallibility of assessment); the criminal sanction offers no possibility of recovery to the injured party; its purpose is to restore the social order to its state prior to the disturbance. (DIAS, 1979, p. 11).
The Traffic Code provides for the institute of reparatory fine in cases where there is conviction for a crime that caused property loss to the victim or their successors, in which case the judge may apply it. The CTB regulates:
Art. 297. The penalty of reparatory fine consists of payment, by judicial deposit in favor of the victim or their successors, of an amount calculated based on the provisions of paragraph 1 of art. 49 of the Penal Code, whenever there is property loss resulting from the crime.
"Paragraph 1. The reparatory fine may not exceed the value of the loss demonstrated in the proceedings."
"Paragraph 2. The provisions of arts. 50 to 52 of the Penal Code apply to the reparatory fine."
"Paragraph 3. In civil compensation for the damage, the value of the reparatory fine shall be discounted."
It is important to note that moral damage is not included in the reparatory fine, and must be claimed through proper channels, since Article 297 of the CTB refers only to the occurrence of "property loss resulting from crime."
In the scope of civil liability, the Traffic Code provided little, with the provisions of the Civil Code, doctrinal construction, and case law in general, applied to traffic, prevailing.
Since, despite its youth, the rules adopted therein are insufficient to resolve the multifarious questions that arise at every moment, once again the Judiciary was entrusted with the difficult mission of establishing the basic premises of the obligation to compensate in cases of accidents arising from the circulation of vehicles, which is why the case law that has formed in a short space of time is multifarious, greatly enriching the repositories of case law precedents. (STOCO, 2004, p. 1376).
Even so, it must be borne in mind that there is no way for laws to foresee all legal situations

Civil liability in automobile traffic accidents - relevant aspects of legislation, doctrine, and case law
with the objective of preventing accidents, because even respecting all traffic rules, the driver is subject to external facts, for which liability may still be attributed to him, because he enjoys the thing.
Conclusion
The paper discusses the most intriguing and debated aspects of civil liability in traffic accidents in light of the legislation relevant to the topic, interpreted by doctrine and case law.
From reading the text, the assumptions for assessing fault can be extracted and the parameters for determining the quantum of compensation can be found, through the study of the rules prescribed in the Civil Code associated with the articles of the Brazilian Traffic Code.
Under the careful perspective of the Courts, it is possible to verify the dynamism with which the matter has been molded to current reality, which portrays a significant increase in the number of accidents involving motor vehicles.
The diversity of cases arising from automobile accidents demanded from doctrine and case law a variety of legal solutions for the legal relationships created between victim, driver, legal guardian, incapacitated person, animals, insured, insurer, beneficiary, State, and interested third parties.
It is certain that a traffic accident triggers a series of legal facts that form a web of legal consequences that can interconnect, in a single case, all these persons in a single proceeding.
The most evident difficulty, then, lies in the production of proof of fault and the extent of the damage. At this point, the degree of fault or existence of intent in the agent's conduct is taken into account, as well as the type of damage and its intensity, whether property, moral, or aesthetic damage, and the corresponding valuation.
The need for expert evidence on a certain thing or person is commonly verified.
The procedural rule, therefore, distributes to the parties the burden or incumbency of producing certain evidence, under penalty of establishing the legal presumption of fault or damage.
Compensation for the losses caused is measured by the judge in the judgment, having as criterion what was produced in the discovery proceedings, and may be determined in the form of monetary payment, pension, obligation to do, or other agreed by the parties, provided that there is no legal prohibition.
Therefore, in matters of civil liability in traffic accidents, the Law meets the peculiarities of the concrete case, because, based on legislation, interpreted by doctrine and case law, it is effective in resolving the conflicts caused by accidents, in order to grant to the litigants the proper legal remedy.
