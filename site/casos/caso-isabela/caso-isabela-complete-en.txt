ISABELA CASE - CRIMINAL PROCEEDING
High-Profile Case
================================================================================

INVESTIGATOR: Why are you hurt, Isabela?
ISABELA: Because I fell. Because I drank too much.
INVESTIGATOR: It wasn't from fighting with your mother, was it?
ISABELA: No. It wasn't.
INVESTIGATOR: So you're saying you didn't do that to your mother?
ISABELA: I didn't.
INVESTIGATOR: And who did?
ISABELA: How would I know, sir? How would I know if I wasn't at home?
INVESTIGATOR: Yes, you were. That clothing of yours, covered in blood, that you left at home. You changed clothes at home.
ISABELA: But who said those clothes are mine? They could be anyone's.
INVESTIGATOR: Whose are they?
ISABELA: My sister was going there today, to the house.
INVESTIGATOR: But she didn't go.
ISABELA: I don't know. She might have gone. Do the clothes have to be mine?
INVESTIGATOR: Look. Here's the thing. You wanted to leave the house and your mother wasn't letting you, isn't that right?
ISABELA: No. No.
INVESTIGATOR: Why was she holding the key in her hand? She died with the key in her hand. The padlock key. And the padlock was locked. So she didn't want to let you leave. Wasn't that how it was?
ISABELA: No.
INVESTIGATOR: You wanted to leave no matter what to use drugs. Wasn't that it?
ISABELA: No.
INVESTIGATOR: Wasn't that how it was?
ISABELA: No, it wasn't.
INVESTIGATOR: Yes, it was. That's how it was.
ISABELA: No, it wasn't.
INVESTIGATOR: See? That's how it was. So you should say it, confess, it's better for you to confess. Either way, you're going to be prosecuted, understand? Everything points to you for what happened. So you confess, it's better, even for your defense it's better for you to confess. Understand? That you use drugs. Understand? You're aware of that, that you use drugs, right?
ISABELA: But are you going to put me in prison? (Isabela starts crying)
INVESTIGATOR: No, no... understand? You confess, it's better for you. Alright? Wasn't that how it happened? Was it?
ISABELA: (Crying) But are you going to put me in prison?
INVESTIGATOR: No. You'll go to a special place to get treatment.
ISABELA: No, I don't want to go to any clinic.
INVESTIGATOR: Isn't that better than going to prison? Isn't it?
ISABELA: No. It isn't.
INVESTIGATOR: It isn't? And where do you want to go?
ISABELA: Home.
INVESTIGATOR: No, you can't. Since this happened, you committed this crime, you have to go somewhere, to be committed so you can recover.
(Cut in video)
ISABELA: Can you get me a cigarette to smoke?
INVESTIGATOR: Tell me if it happened that way. Was that how it was? And I'll get you one. Wasn't that how it happened?
ISABELA: (Nodding affirmatively) It was...
INVESTIGATOR: It was like that, wasn't it? You wanted to leave the house to use drugs, and your mother wasn't letting you leave. Wasn't that it?
ISABELA: (Nodding affirmatively in silence)
INVESTIGATOR: Then you grabbed the knife. That whole thing. You got into a fight, right? Then what happened, happened. Isn't that right? Okay, alright... You'll go somewhere to be committed, to recover from this. Because you're addicted to drugs, aren't you?
ISABELA: I am.
INVESTIGATOR: You used a lot yesterday.
ISABELA: I did.
INVESTIGATOR: You did? And you drank too?
ISABELA: Uh-huh.
INVESTIGATOR: Right? Okay...
ISABELA: Are you going to get me a cigarette?
INVESTIGATOR: I will, I'll get one.
