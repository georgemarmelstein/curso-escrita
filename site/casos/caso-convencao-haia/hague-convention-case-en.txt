International Law - International Child Abduction
================================================================================

FEDERAL COURT OF CEARA
3RD DIVISION
FEDERAL JUDGE: GEORGE MARMELSTEIN
CASE No. 2008.81.00923.04.00

Complaint

THE FEDERAL UNION (BRAZIL), upon request from the Federal Republic of Germany, files, pursuant to the Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, promulgated in Brazil by Decree No. 3413 of 2000, the present EMERGENCY PETITION FOR SEARCH, SEIZURE, AND RETURN OF A MINOR against CLAUDIA DE SOUSA, based on the following facts:

STATEMENT OF FACTS

In 2014, the respondent Claudia de Sousa met Mr. Fritz Herman, a German citizen, while he was vacationing in Brazil.

Since that time, they maintained a romantic relationship and decided to live together in the city of Frankfurt, Germany.

After one year of their relationship, they had a son: Mathews, who was born on January 2, 2016.

In July 2018, the couple decided to vacation in Brazil so that the child could meet Claudia's family. The return tickets were scheduled for August 2018.

One week before the scheduled return date, Claudia informed Fritz that she did not intend to return to Germany and that their child would stay with her. Fritz did not agree but had to return to Germany to avoid losing his job.

It should be noted that, under German law, when there is no separation or court order, custody of the child is held jointly by both father and mother.

As a result, the Federal Central Administrative Authority in Germany requested direct international legal cooperation in civil matters from Brazil, in order to return the minor Mathews to that country, who is being illegally retained in Brazilian territory, as set forth above.

This action therefore seeks to enforce the provisions of the Hague Convention, with the objective of searching for, seizing, and returning the minor Mathews to the country of his habitual residence, Germany. It should be noted that the child's father has agreed to bear the expenses arising from the return.

LEGAL BASIS

Article 3 of the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction provides:

"Art. 3. The removal or the retention of a child is to be considered wrongful where:
a) it is in breach of rights of custody attributed to a person, an institution or any other body, either jointly or alone, under the law of the State in which the child was habitually resident immediately before the removal or retention; and
b) at the time of removal or retention those rights were actually exercised, either jointly or alone, or would have been so exercised but for the removal or retention. The rights of custody mentioned in sub-paragraph (a) above may arise in particular by operation of law or by reason of a judicial or administrative decision, or by reason of an agreement having legal effect under the law of that State."

RELIEF REQUESTED

In light of the foregoing, THE FEDERAL UNION requests that an emergency measure of search and seizure be granted so that the minor Mathews Herman be immediately returned to the Federal Republic of Germany, seizing him from whoever wrongfully possesses him, including his passport, and proceeding promptly with the proper return.

The Plaintiff reserves the right to produce documentary, testimonial, expert evidence, judicial inspection, and all means of proof, even if not specified in the Code of Civil Procedure, provided they are morally legitimate and lawfully obtained, thus all evidence admissible in law.

The amount in controversy is set at R$ 10,000.00 for tax purposes.

Answer

CLAUDIA DE SOUZA, duly identified in the case record, respectfully submits this ANSWER TO THE COMPLAINT, based on the following facts and arguments:

The respondent did, in fact, live in Germany with Mr. Fritz and had with him the son Mathews, who was born in 2016.

In 2018, the relationship between them was quite deteriorated when they decided to come to Brazil so that the child could meet his maternal grandparents.

The respondent did, in fact, refuse to return to Germany, but for serious reasons.

In truth, since Mathews was born, Fritz became aggressive toward the respondent and, whenever he drank, he would assault her.

Claudia did report her partner to the German police. In 2017, a Police Report was filed describing an assault by Fritz against Claudia, a copy of which is in the case file. However, the police closed the investigation for lack of evidence.

The only witness who saw the events was a taxi driver named Albert Einstein, but he refused to testify to the police.

Unable to bear living in that environment of domestic violence any longer, she decided to return to live with her family in Brazil. For the respondent, this is the situation that best protects the interests of the child, as his return would represent a grave risk, both physical and psychological.

LEGAL BASIS

Article 13(b) of the Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction provides:

"Notwithstanding the provisions of the preceding Article, the judicial or administrative authority of the requested State is not bound to order the return of the child if the person, institution or other body which opposes its return establishes that: [...]
(b) there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation."

RELIEF REQUESTED

In light of the foregoing, the respondent requests that the claims be denied.

The respondent requests, as evidence, to hear by WhatsApp her neighbor who lives in Germany.

Reply

THE FEDERAL UNION respectfully submits this REPLY TO THE ANSWER, based on the following facts and arguments:

The Federal Union reaffirms the terms of the complaint.

There is no evidence that domestic violence occurred. The German police themselves, who investigated the report made by the respondent, concluded that there was no evidence that Fritz assaulted Claudia.

Furthermore, the exception of grave risk as a factor for non-return of the child refers to the physical and psychological integrity of the child and not of the mother. There is no evidence that Fritz beat the child, nor that any violence against the mother occurred in the presence of the child.

For these reasons, the Federal Union reiterates the need for immediate granting of the emergency measure.
