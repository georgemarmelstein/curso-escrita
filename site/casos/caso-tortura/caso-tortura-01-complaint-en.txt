TORTURE CASE - COMPLAINT
================================================================================

TO THE HONORABLE FEDERAL JUDGE OF THE _______ COURT OF THE JUDICIAL SECTION OF FORTALEZA - CEARA

"For the tortured, in torture, only the exit remains - unimaginably difficult - of silence. Through it, one guarantees and affirms, in heroic degree, one's integrity as a person, through the realization of a supreme value. The torturer, this one has no exit, none. When successful - and this is his best hypothesis -, the torturer, like the hyena, begins to feed on a corpse." (Helio Pellegrino, in The Stupidity of the Demon).

"They tortured me so much that I fainted, Elisa. When I opened my eyes, I was no longer on the pau-de-arara, I was lying on a stretcher, in another room (...) I thought: I must not be dying (...) But the worst, Elisa, came later ..." (Roberto Drumond, Coca-Cola Blood, a work with excerpts inspired by the experience of Jose Adao Pinto, collected by the novelist)

FRANCISCO DA SILVA, Brazilian, married, military, ID No. 00000000 SSP/CE, and Taxpayer ID 000.000.000-00, residing at ADDRESS 1, ZIP 60.511-480 in Fortaleza-CE, comes, respectfully, before Your Honor, through his attorneys, to file an ORDINARY ACTION FOR MORAL DAMAGES against the Federal Government, headquartered in this Capital, at Rua Vilebaldo Aguiar, 96, Ed. Duets Office Towers - North Tower, 9th, 11th and 12th floors - Coco - Fortaleza - CE - Zip 60192-010, in the person of its legal representative, for the factual and legal grounds set forth below:

STATEMENT OF FACTS

FRANCISCO DA SILVA, in March 2003, enlisted in mandatory military service in the 10th Military Region, as a soldier. With exactly 1 month of service, in April 2003, the plaintiff was participating in Day and Night Compass Orientation Training held at Fortaleza Air Base, which was made available for Army training.

During this training, the Plaintiff suffered severe assaults by Lieutenant Pedro, Corporal Arlindo, and Private Nascimento, as shown in the (attached documents) of the investigation opened at the time, conducted by the 23rd Hunter Battalion, Order 24/Sect of April 2003.

The Plaintiff was assaulted by the aforementioned with kicks to the arms, multiple stomps on the head, causing various injuries that he continues to live with to this day, in addition to receiving several death threats from Lieutenant Pedro.

Witnesses to the assaults suffered include Leandro (witness 1), Carlos (witness 2), and Leonardo (witness 3), all soldiers from the 10th Military Region who served together with the Plaintiff.

In May 2003, he suffered new torture attacks, both physical and psychological, during training conducted in the jungle, receiving multiple club blows to the left knee, throat, and head, being forced to drink hot mud and lie on it, causing him even more injuries including ear, throat, and knee problems, having to take various medications and undergo endless treatments, as the treatments only alleviate his pain, but unfortunately, Your Honor, there is no cure and he will have to live with these afflictions until his death due to the abuses he suffered in the army while serving.

It should be noted that after these assaults, the Plaintiff was hospitalized due to the attacks and the physical state they left him in, for at least 10 (TEN) days, but after this other beating, he preferred to remain silent to avoid a new investigation and to prevent the incident from repeating itself on other occasions and trainings, causing him great panic and fear.

The Plaintiff was discharged from the Army on 11/28/2003, but as previously stated, he continues to suffer from the traumas and injuries from the incidents, having various health problems, such as respiratory problems, swelling of face and eyes at various times of the day, secretions from the ears along with other hearing problems, and is undergoing psychological and psychiatric treatment at CAPS, performs various tests through the public health system, and through tests was diagnosed with Chronic Laryngitis (LPRD - Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease).

Since his arrival in the Brazilian army, he suffered discriminatory and racist conduct, as if living under an authoritarian regime, was subjected to violent physical and psychological torture, without any reason, at least unknown to the Plaintiff, as he always had excellent behavior during his service period as shown by the attached good conduct certificates. The winds of democracy that blew in this Country from 1988 onwards rekindled hope of justice for torture victims before its advent, and to accept this type of conduct today is to assassinate our Federal Constitution. And as it is known as the Mother Constitution, it brings with it the possibility of compensation for material and moral damages suffered during the previous regime and for all who continue to suffer from it in current times (OUTRAGEOUS).

This is the reason why the Plaintiff comes to the Judiciary through this action. The torturers are protected. However, amnesty does not affect, nor could it, the just right to compensation. In fact, the Law is undoubtedly favorable to the Plaintiff's claim: the facts have a solid evidentiary basis, the damage is clear, as is the strict liability of the Federal Government. It is now necessary to establish all these elements.

LEGAL GROUNDS

As is known, civil liability arises from the conjunction of three elements: damage, causal connection, and fault. In the case of state liability, when the conduct is commissive, proof of fault is unnecessary, requiring only the existence of a causal relationship between the conduct of the public agent and the damage. In the present case, the moral damage emerges from the facts themselves.

The Plaintiff was subjected to inquisitorial-type procedure. Being subjected to various types of physical and psychological torture while serving the Brazilian army. Without regular process, without trial, without judicial oversight. At the same time, in the facilities of the 10th Military Region, during his entire period of military service, he lived in constant fear of suffering everything he had already suffered, plus the fear of dying from death threats he received inside due to the investigation opened after the first beating he had received.

After this phase, he was discharged from the Army on 11/28/2003. As consequences of this terrible period, he was left with various health problems, such as respiratory problems, swelling of face and eyes at various times of the day, secretions from the ears along with other hearing problems, and is undergoing psychological and psychiatric treatment at CAPS, performs various tests through the public health system, and through tests was diagnosed with Chronic Laryngitis (LPRD - Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease), all resulting from the aforementioned facts, where these torturers beat, kicked, forced to drink mud, choked, and clubbed the Plaintiff. Also on the list of damages, it should be remembered the dismantling of his personal life, including from a professional and material point of view. Discharged at the end of 2003, today in 2018, he still has not been able to rebuild his life, as he lives daily treating his physical and psychological afflictions, with long waiting lines and bureaucracy of the public health system and CAPS, to alleviate his pains and injuries obtained during his time of service in the Brazilian army, which did not care for his physical and mental integrity and turned a blind eye to this type of occurrence.

The facts and damages in the "Brazil: Never Again" research.

The reported facts, which in themselves and in their effects constitute moral damage. Here, in summary, are the moral damages: psychological torture, physical torture and its injuries abundantly described above, the physical consequences of this period, especially chronic laryngitis and constant swelling in the face and eyes, and also all the psychological suffering, resulting from the trauma experienced and the fact of having his life destroyed, all the prejudice suffered, his personal identity semi-destroyed. As for psychological suffering, see the case law (presumption of truth of damage): "Simply moral damage, without repercussion on the patrimony, cannot be proven. It exists solely by the offense, and from it is presumed, being enough to justify compensation." (TJPR - 4th C. - Ap. Rel. Wilson Reback - j. 12.12.90 - RT 681/163). Regarding the causal relationship and the responsibility of the Federal Government: Like the damages, the causal connection naturally flows from the narrative of facts. Evidently, if the Plaintiff suffered torture and mistreatment in the facilities of a federal institution, it is up to the Federal Government to compensate him for the damages suffered. Also because his tormentors were federal public agents - army soldiers -, in the exercise of the prerogatives of their function. In this case, the Plaintiff suffered all these tortures during training conducted by the Brazilian Army, in Ceara. There, Army soldiers, of various ranks, tortured him, as already described: MILITARY 1, MILITARY 2, and MILITARY 3. Since the harmful conduct was committed by federal public servants, civil liability falls on the Federal Government, in the strict liability modality. The Civil Code, art. 1521, item III, established that the employer, master or principal is responsible for civil reparation, for their employees, servants and agents, in the exercise of the work that is their responsibility, or on the occasion thereof. And according to Supreme Court Precedent 341: "The fault of the employer or principal is presumed for the culpable act of the employee or agent." The Federal Constitution of 1988, on the other hand, enshrined the principle of strict liability in its art. 37, sixth paragraph: "legal entities under public law and those under private law providing public services shall be liable for damages that their agents, in that capacity, cause to third parties, with the right of recourse against the responsible party in cases of intent or fault." And the best doctrine teaches: "Abuse in the exercise of functions, by the servant does not exclude the strict liability of the Administration. Rather, it aggravates it, because such abuse carries the implicit presumption of poor choice of the public agent for the mission that had been assigned to him. (...) Without inquiring whether they come from jus imperii or jus gestionis, since both are forms of administrative action." (Hely Lopes Meireles, Brazilian Administrative Law, 16th ed., Revista dos Tribunais, 1991, p. 551/2). It is inappropriate to file suit against the torturers, because as the same Hely Lopes observes, "the victim's compensation action must be filed solely against the responsible public entity, the servant not being admissible in the lawsuit. The injured party by an act of the Administration has nothing to do with the agent causing the damage, since his right, constitutionally recognized (art. 37, §6), is to be compensated by the legal entity and not by the direct agent of the injury. On the other hand, the guilty servant is not obligated to repair the damage to the victim, since he only answers for his act and for his omission before the Administration he serves, and only in a recourse action can he be civilly liable. (...) The constitutional legislator well separated the responsibilities: the State compensates the victim; the agent compensates the State, through recourse." (idem, p. 555). Moral damages The expression "moral damage" encompasses both the disturbance of a person's feelings and those "spiritual" goods or values (physical integrity, dignity, honor, family, etc.). The Federal Constitution of 1988 lists the essential values of Brazilian society, under the heading "Fundamental Rights and Guarantees." According to the Fundamental Law, art. 5, no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment (item III), freedom of conscience is inviolable (item IV), no one shall be deprived of rights on grounds of political conviction (item VIII), there shall be no special or extraordinary courts (XXXVII), prisoners are assured respect for physical and moral integrity (XLIX), no one shall be deprived of liberty or property without due process of law (LIV), among others. Note that the 1988 Constitution did not bring major innovations. The previous constitution, of 1967, provided for a list of fundamental rights similar to those cited above. Furthermore, since 1948, Brazil has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which embraces and guarantees these same rights. Other international treaties followed, and Brazil was bound by them. Therefore, even in the legal order prior to 1988, the acts committed against the Plaintiff constituted serious wrongs, giving rise to compensation.

The Plaintiff was humiliated, tortured - physically and psychologically - He lost fifteen years of his life seeking treatment for his injuries through the public health system and CAPS. He endured attacks on his condition as a Black person, being a victim of the cruelest racism.

All without the slightest possibility of a regular process - due process of law. In short, he was injured in fundamental rights such as physical and psychological integrity, freedom of movement, freedom of conscience, the right to adversarial proceedings and full defense. In the psychological aspect, one can calculate the pain felt, the anguish, the fear. In addition, the consequences of the assaults suffered remained, especially chronic laryngitis and swelling in the face, eyes, and secretions from the ears.

Case law has established some criteria for setting the value of compensation for moral damage. The valuation is objective and not arbitrary, and must take into account the peculiarities of each case. Criteria such as the socioeconomic condition of the offender and the injured party, the extent of the damage, the pain experienced by the victim, the degree of intent or fault of the offender, and the importance of the moral and spiritual goods injured have been discussed.

Thus, considering the greatness and essentiality of the injured goods, the existing injuries, the need of the Plaintiff and the capacity of the Defendant (federal political entity), as well as the satisfactory and preventive aspect of compensation, finally, considering all the above criteria and with eyes on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is understood that compensation for moral damage should not be less than 10,000 minimum wages, in today's values, R$ 9,540,000.00.
