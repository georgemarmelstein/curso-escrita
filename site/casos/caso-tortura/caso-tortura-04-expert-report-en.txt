EXPERT REPORT

1. History of Present Illness:

The examinee appears for the medical examination with a companion and walking without assistance from others and without the aid of devices.

Interview with the plaintiff's wife named Geiza.

During the medical history, the plaintiff's wife informed us that around April 2003 he suffered torture, beatings, and assaults while serving in the army. She reports that around mid-2003 he suffered new attacks of both physical and psychological torture.

After these events, the plaintiff began to present persistent auditory and visual hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and aggressiveness.

At the time, he sought medical assistance and after medical examinations was diagnosed as having schizophrenic disorder. Initially, he received a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD 10 F43.1).

"Extremities: no edema or signs of DVT.

Nutritional status: well-nourished.

The text appears to be an excerpt from a medical discussion about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to traumatic/stressful events at work.

It mentions that the plaintiff presented diagnostic criteria compatible with PTSD, but which can be defined as "occupational post-traumatic stress disorder" or "work-related post-traumatic stress disorder."

There are two central characteristics: 1) exposure to an event involving threat of death or serious injury to oneself or others, and 2) the development of highly specific symptoms related to this traumatic event, such as response and persistent re-experiencing of autonomic hyperarousal symptoms.

To define an event as traumatic according to the DSM-V, it must satisfy two parts of criterion "A": 1) the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with one or more events involving threat of death or serious physical injury, or threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others; 2) the person reacted with intense fear, helplessness, or horror.

Currently in persistent treatment with a condition that has evolved to psychotic disorder (see medication) and occasional re-experiencing of traumatic events in stimulating situations. In some cases, the conditions persist for a prolonged period, even if adequate treatments are initiated, and may be considered temporary, but in these cases the author suggests that it be considered permanent work disability.

The image presents an excerpt from a document discussing the concept of work disability. According to the text, work disability should be understood as the impossibility of performing work duties due to medical, physical, or mental changes, arising from various situations. The concept of disability encompasses issues such as aggravation of the illness, risks to the life of the employee or third parties, and what continuation of work may entail.

Work disability is different from the impossibility of performance due to specific changes in an activity or profession, and the concept of disability comprises an analysis of the following parameters: degree, duration, and scope of the task performed.
