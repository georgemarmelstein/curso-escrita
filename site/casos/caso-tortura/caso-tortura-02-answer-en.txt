TORTURE CASE - ANSWER
================================================================================

TO THE HONORABLE FEDERAL JUDGE OF THE 3RD COURT

FEDERAL OF THE STATE OF CEARA.

Case: No. 0812444-73.2018.4.05.8100

Plaintiff: FRANCISCO DA SILVA

Defendant: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, a legal entity of public law,

represented pursuant to Complementary Law No. 73/93, by this

Attorney's Office in Ceara, comes before Your Honor, through the undersigned

attorney, in the case file referenced above, based on the relevant

procedural legislation, to timely file (service of process on 08/24/2018),

its ANSWER, for the reasons set forth below:

FACTUAL SUMMARY

This is an Ordinary Action for Compensation for Moral

Damages, against the Federal Government (Brazilian Army). The Plaintiff alleges that in March

2003 he enlisted in mandatory military service at the 10th Military Region, as a

soldier, and with exactly 1 month of service, in April 2003, the plaintiff allegedly

suffered severe assaults by Lieutenant Pedro, Corporal Arlindo, and Private Nascimento.

This is a brief summary of the complaint, whose claims do not merit

success, for the reasons set forth below.

ON THE MERITS

Initially, it is appropriate to transcribe the information from

Official Letter No. 088/2018 - Asse Ap Ass Jurd/10 - Brazilian Army 10th

Military Region (MINISTRY OF DEFENSE):

"The military career is not an unspecific and disposable activity, a simple job, an occupation, but an absorbing and exclusive profession, which conditions and self-limits us to the end. It does not require from us the working hours of the law, but all the hours of life, also imposing on us our destinies. The uniform is not a garment, which is removed with ease and even indifference, but another skin, which adheres to the soul itself, irreversibly forever." (Gen Octavio Costa)

These information concern an ordinary proceeding brought by former Variable Effective Soldier (Sd EV) of the Command Company of the 10th Military Region of the Brazilian Army (23rd BC), headquartered in Fortaleza/CE, FRANCISCO DA SILVA, seeking compensation for moral damages on the allegation that he was physically and psychologically assaulted during the period he served in the Army.

The plaintiff does not state, in his complaint, the date he enlisted in the Brazilian Army. He alleges, in brief summary, only that in April 2003, during "compass orientation training" he suffered various physical assaults, which allegedly left consequences, in addition to various threats, which allegedly occurred again on another occasion, in May of the same year, having been hospitalized for 10 days.

He further states that he was discharged from the Brazilian Army on November 28, 2003, and that he continues, since then, to suffer due to the consequences of the traumas suffered, for which he requests compensation for moral damages.

Preliminarily, it is essential to point out the lapse of the statute of limitations in this case. As is known, the Civil Code of 2002, more specifically in item V of paragraph 3 of article 206, establishes that the claim for civil reparation, as in the present case involving compensation for moral damage, is three years. Thus, the plaintiff narrates facts that occurred in 2003 and seeks compensation for them in 2018, 15 years later. There is no doctrinal or jurisprudential discussion about such limitations period, as can be seen in the case law cited below:

The following is the transcript of the requested excerpt:

07. Thus, it should be noted that the Plaintiff's request for compensation for moral damages has no legal support, since there was no illegality or arbitrariness during his Active Service.

08. The Plaintiff requests compensation for moral damages suffered due to alleged practice of illegal acts by the Army, since he has been feeling great psychological distress, revolt, pain, sadness, and apprehension that reveal moral damage.

09. Such allegations should be considered mere sophisms of someone who alleges without even presenting conclusive evidence to prove the psychological damage suffered.

10. It is evident that moral damage has numerous definitions in national doctrine: Pablo Stolze and Rodolfo Pamplona conceptualize it as "injury to rights whose content is not pecuniary, nor commercially reducible to money" (GAGLIANO; PAMPLONA FILHO, 2003, p. 55). Similarly, Maria Helena Diniz establishes moral damage as "the injury to non-patrimonial interests of a natural or legal person, caused by the harmful act." (DINIZ, 2003, p. 84). Scholar Carlos Roberto Goncalves, when conceptualizing moral damage, states that: "Moral damage is that which affects the injured party as a person, not harming his patrimony. It is injury to a good that is part of the rights of personality, such as honor, dignity, intimacy, image, good name, etc., as can be inferred from art. 1, III, and 5, V and X, of the Federal Constitution, and which causes the injured party pain, suffering, sadness, embarrassment and humiliation" (GONCALVES, 2009, p.359)."

13. Claims for moral damages such as the one in this case, completely unfounded and large, discredit and trivialize the institute of moral damage, because they wound it in its credibility, as Ricardo Bechara Santos teaches - in his work "Law in Combat" in Sergio's Column in the "Forensic Law" Notebook - Rio de Janeiro - 1999: "Moral damage, on the other hand, CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE ENSHRINED IN A GENEROUS, PHILANTHROPIC, EMOTIONAL THESIS." In reality, the most trivial annoyances of everyday life are today being equated to suffering qualified as unbearable result of strong moral pain. One can almost affirm that any setback, even if commonplace, is for some, labeled as infinite moral damage, aiming only at receiving compensation. Moral damage must be effective and clear, and cannot be considered as such a small setback to which we are all subject in the day-to-day life of large cities.

14. In this sense is the most sought-after case law, extracted from national courts, worthy of transcription given its extreme pertinence to the case under review:

"(...) I have recognized that there is abuse in claims for compensation for moral damage. Unfortunately, they are being distorted, people are wanting to make money at the expense of others, which, moreover, in the economic model in which we live, has become a fashion, and people are transferring this, also, to this area. Absurd situations have already arisen, such as requesting compensation for moral damage for a traffic accident, because the individual was disturbed by the car crash! I would say it is almost without comment, however they are claiming. Life is made of discomforts and disturbances, as I have said, any day compensation will be requested, because someone on the street, looked mean, looked fixedly and the person was shaken, claims compensation for moral damage! (...)" (Justice Sergio Gichkow Pereira, in Motions for Clarification No. 596234443, 3rd Civil Group of TJRS, on 03.07.1997).

15. In this context, proof of the damage suffered is essential, whether material or immaterial, for civil liability and consequent obligation to compensate to be established, which does not occur in this case, making any claim for compensation for moral damage allegedly suffered inappropriate.

16. In view of the above, this Advisory Office for Legal Affairs advocates preliminarily for recognition of the statute of limitations, with due dismissal of the action with judgment on the merits, and, on the merits, for total dismissal of the claim, given the lack of any element to support the Plaintiff's claim, judging this to be the pertinent information to support the defense of the Federal Government.

ON THE NON-OCCURRENCE OF MORAL DAMAGES

As seen in the information provided by the 10th MR, there is

no basis for speaking of the occurrence of the facts alleged by the plaintiff. At

no time did the plaintiff prove his allegations.

The plaintiff requests compensation for moral damages suffered due to

alleged illegal acts by Lieutenant Pedro, Corporal Arlindo, and Private Nascimento, alleging that he suffered severe assaults, great

psychological distress, revolt, sadness, and apprehension that reveal moral

damage.

It is evident that moral damage has numerous definitions

in national doctrine: Pablo Stolze and Rodolfo Pamplona conceptualize it as "injury

to rights whose content is not pecuniary, nor commercially reducible to

money" (GAGLIANO; PAMPLONA FILHO, 2003, p. 55). Similarly,

Maria Helena Diniz establishes moral damage as "the injury to non-

patrimonial interests of a natural or legal person, caused by the harmful act." (DINIZ,

2003, p. 84).

Scholar Carlos Roberto Goncalves, when conceptualizing

moral damage states that: "Moral damage is that which affects the injured party as a person,

not harming his patrimony. It is injury to a good that is part of the rights of

personality, such as honor, dignity, intimacy, image, good name,

etc., as can be inferred from art. 1, III, and 5, V and X, of the Federal Constitution, and which

causes the injured party pain, suffering, sadness, embarrassment and humiliation"

(GONCALVES, 2009, p.359)."

Doctrine establishes that a claim for moral damages

must also be based on the triple requirement of harm, the culpable act

of the agent (conduct error marked by imprudence, malpractice, and negligence)

and the causal connection between said act and the harmful result (Civil Code,

art. 186), with the injured party bearing, in principle, the burden of proving the occurrence of

the three aforementioned requirements.

It is notorious that the complaint was not accompanied by

essential documents proving the alleged moral damages

eventually suffered by the plaintiff. On this topic, it is worth bringing to bear the

thinking of HUMBERTO THEODORO JUNIOR, extracted from an article he

published entitled "Civil Liability for Moral Damage," which is

crystallized in the following excerpt:

More than in any other type of compensation, compensation for

moral damage must be imposed from the very foundation of

civil liability, which does not aim to create an unjustified source of profit and advantages without cause. For all the best scholars of the

complicated topic, the updated doctrine of Caio Mario regarding

arbitration of compensation for moral damage applies: And, if in any case

the victim is given compensation for damno vittando, and not for lucro

capiendo, more than ever the concern must be present to

contain the compensation within reason, so that it never becomes

a source of enrichment.

Claims for moral damages without assessing evidence

are completely unfounded and discredit and trivialize the institute

of moral damage, because they wound it in its credibility, as Ricardo

Bechara Santos teaches - in his work "Insurance Law in Daily Life" - Forense Publisher

- Rio de Janeiro - 1999: "Moral damage, on the other hand, CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT

BE ENSHRINED IN A GENEROUS, PHILANTHROPIC, EMOTIONAL THESIS."

In reality, the most trivial annoyances of everyday life

are today being equated to suffering qualified as unbearable

result of strong moral pain. One can almost affirm that any

setback, even if commonplace, is for some, labeled as infinite moral

damage, aiming only at receiving compensation. Moral damage must

be effective and clear, and cannot be considered as such a small

setback to which we are all subject in the day-to-day life of large cities.

In this sense is the most sought-after case law, extracted

from national courts, worthy of transcription given its extreme pertinence to the case

under review:

(...). I have recognized that there is abuse in claims for

compensation for moral damage. Unfortunately, they are being distorted,

people are wanting to make money at the expense of others, which,

moreover, in the economic model in which we live, has become

a fashion, and people are transferring this, also, to this

area. Absurd situations have already arisen, such as requesting compensation for

moral damage for a traffic accident, because the individual was

disturbed by the car crash! I would say it is almost without

comment, however they are claiming. Life is made of

discomforts and disturbances. As I have said, any day compensation will be requested,

because someone on the street, looked mean, looked fixedly and the person

was shaken, claims compensation for moral damage! (...)" (Justice

Sergio Gichkow Pereira, in Motions for Clarification No. 596234443, 3rd

Civil Group of TJRS, on 03.07.1997).

UNNAMED APPEAL. DAMAGES CLAIM. PAYMENT

OF BILLS WITH COINS. LOTTERY OUTLET REFUSAL.

ALLEGATION OF HUMILIATION. MORAL DAMAGE NOT

PROVEN. The plaintiff seeks reversal of the judgment of

dismissal of the action, alleging that he was embarrassed by the

defendant, manager of the Lottery Outlet, who refused to accept

payment of his bills with R$ 200.00 in coins and humiliated him. Although payment of bills with coins is

valid, there is no evidence in the record of an embarrassing situation experienced by

the plaintiff. Furthermore, in the case of a busy lottery outlet,

the time spent counting the coins

would certainly result in harm to serving the other customers.

A situation that with due restraint and good sense could have been

resolved. The evidence produced does not show

embarrassing, humiliating, or offensive conduct faced by the plaintiff to admit compensatory moral

damage. It is emphasized that damage or injury to

personality, deserving of compensation under this title, would only

be established with the exposure of the consumer to a humiliating situation,

as well as offense to an attribute of his honor, image, or any of the

personal rights protected by art. 5, items V and X, of CF/88, which

was not shown to be proven in the case. Witness listed

by the plaintiff whose statements are contradictory to the

factual situation portrayed in the complaint, notably as to the time of

the occurrence, since the complaint states that the fact occurred in February 2015,

while... the declarant states that it was "last week,"

since his testimony occurred in June 2015 (p. 11). APPEAL

DENIED. (Civil Appeal No. 71005809009, Second

Civil Appellate Panel, Appellate Panels, Rapporteur: Roberto Carvalho Fraga,

Judged on 03/01/2016). (TJ-RS - Civil Appeal: 71005809009 RS,

Rapporteur: Roberto Carvalho Fraga, Judgment Date: 03/01/2016,

Second Civil Appellate Panel, Publication Date: Official

Gazette of 03/03/2016).

For all the above, proof of the causal connection

between the actions of the Military Administration and the harm suffered is essential, whether

material or immaterial, as well as how these damages affected the

honor of the plaintiff, for civil liability and

consequent obligation to compensate to be established, which does not occur in this case,

making any claim for compensation for Moral Damage suffered inappropriate.

Now, there is no basis for speaking of moral damage, given the

absence of the basic prerequisite for its establishment: the existence of causal

connection. Moreover, the plaintiff does not even present solid arguments proving that the

Military Administration acted illegally. On this point, PAULO DE

TARSO VIEIRA warns (in Civil Liability in the Consumer Code and the Defense

of the Supplier; Sao Paulo, Saraiva, 2002):

Some facts of life do not go beyond the frontier of mere

annoyances or setbacks. These are the disappointments or

normal disruptions of life in society, which do not allow the

effective identification of the occurrence of moral damage. A traffic

accident, for example, with merely property damages,

constitutes a disruption for those involved, but certainly does not allow the identification, in the vast majority of cases, of the

occurrence of moral damage to any of them.

(...)

The difficulty of doctrine has been to circumscribe, within the limits of

a definition, the common elements pertaining to the immense range

of modalities of moral damages, including harm

resulting from aggressions to the right to life, to physical-psychological integrity,

to honor, to freedom, to intimacy, to private life, to

image, both of natural and legal persons.

Exactly due to the diversity of legal goods

susceptible to being affected, moral damages began to be classified

as subjective and objective. Subjective moral damage is that

which affects the sphere of psychological intimacy, having as effect the

feelings of pain, anguish, and suffering for the injured person.

In contrast, objective moral damage is that which affects the

moral dimension of the person in his social sphere, causing

harm to the image of the injured party in the social environment, although

it may also cause pain and suffering.

(...).

Simple disruptions and annoyances of social life, although

unpleasant, do not have sufficient relevance, by themselves, to

constitute moral damage. One must evaluate, in the concrete case,

the extent of the fact and its consequences for the person, so that

one can verify the effective occurrence of moral damage. (...)."

In light of the principle of reasonableness and the principle of

proportionality, no compensable moral damage is established in

this case. Sergio Cavalieri Filho, in turn, teaches with great clarity:

In the difficult question of knowing what constitutes moral damage,

the judge must follow the trail of reasonable logic, in search of

normal ethical-social sensitivity. He must take as paradigm the

citizen who is equally distant from the cold, insensitive man

and the man of extreme sensitivity. Along this principle,

only pain, embarrassment, suffering

or humiliation should be considered as moral damage which, departing from normality, intensely interferes

with the psychological behavior of the individual, causing him affliction,

anguish, and imbalance in his well-being, mere

disappointment, annoyance, resentment, irritation, or exacerbated sensitivity not being sufficient." (Civil Liability Program, Ed. Atlas,

2007).

The plaintiff did not experience any type of embarrassment,

that would cause offense to his personal rights, to warrant application of

article 5, X, of CF/88, especially there was no injury to his image, honor. Moral

damage, verbi gratia, only occurs when there is injury to extra-patrimonial patrimony. At

most, there was a mere annoyance incapable of pecuniary compensation.

On this topic, it is appropriate to transcribe the lesson of Prof. ANTONIO CHAVES:

To advocate for broad compensability of moral damage does not imply

recognition that any and all sensitivity, all exacerbated

susceptibility, all exaltation of self-love, allegedly wounded, the

softest shadow, the slightest brushing of a butterfly's wings,

niceties, scruples, excessive delicacies, insignificant illusions

undone, would allow hundreds of thousands of cruzeiros to be extracted from the Pandora's box of Law

(in Treaty of Civil Law, 3rd ed.,

Sao Paulo, Revista dos Tribunais, 1985, vol. III, p. 637).

For all the above, proof of the causal

connection and its relationship to the harm suffered is essential, whether material or

immaterial, for civil liability and consequent

obligation to compensate to be established, which does not occur in this case, making any

claim for compensation for moral damage suffered inappropriate.

ON THE THREE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS - CIVIL LIABILITY

The plaintiff alleges that the facts underlying his

claim occurred in April 2003, fifteen years ago.

Initially, the statute of limitations should be raised due to

the lapse of the THREE-YEAR PERIOD that preceded the filing of the action, in view of the

advent of the Civil Code of 2002, which caused significant changes in the treatment

of the statute of limitations in favor of the Treasury, as will be demonstrated below.

In fact, with the publication of Law No. 10,406/2002, which

instituted the new Civil Code, substantial changes were felt in the part

relating to the statute of limitations, especially with the discipline of art. 206, § 3, item V,

which established a three-year limitations period for "civil reparation claims."

In this context, it should be noted that the issuance of Decree

No. 20,910/32, establishing the prerogative for the Treasury of a

five-year limitations period, was justified, at the time it arose in the Brazilian

legal system, by the principle of supremacy of the public interest and material equality.

Through such principles, it can be inferred that the prerogatives conferred

on public law entities exist for the purpose of enabling the fulfillment of the

administrative function by the State. Therefore, the special deadlines granted to the

Treasury do not constitute unjustified favoritism or privileges,

since they were granted with the aim of providing the public entity with efficient instruments for the exercise of its activities, consequently, for the promotion

of the interest of all the collectivity.

Thus, the granting of prerogatives

by the ordinary legislator is justified, among which the limitations one, with respect to the

Federal Government. Then, let us see:

The Civil Code of 1916, in its article 117, provided for a

limitations period of 20 (twenty) years for personal actions, 10 (ten) years for

real actions between present parties and 15 (fifteen) between absent ones. Given this reality,

Decree No. 20,910/32 was issued, providing for a five-year limitations period for

actions filed against the Treasury, in clear compliance with the

principles cited above. Subsequently, with the issuance of Decree-Law No.

4,597/42 and, finally, of Law No. 9,494/97, with the wording given by Provisional

Measure No. 2,180-35/2001, the granting of such prerogative regarding the

statute of limitations was ratified.

Once the legislator's interest in granting

a differentiated situation to public entities when in court has been demonstrated, we move

to the second consideration, namely, the institution of the new Civil Code of

2002 and the need for a dialogical interpretation of its provisions and,

here, the one that interests us - the limitations period.

Thus, it is understood that if Law No. 10,406/02

provides, in its article 206, § 3, V, already cited, that the limitations period is THREE

years in personal actions involving only natural or

legal persons of a private nature, nothing more reasonable than that the same period be

extended to the Treasury when it is the defendant in the

lawsuit, since the continued application of the five-year period contained in

Decree 20,910/32 constitutes a true breach of principles that permeate

our legal system.

Obviously, it is known that most current doctrine and

case law understand that the specialty character of Decree

20,910/32 prevails over the Civil Code of 2002, considering this a

general rule and that, thus, according to article 3, § 2 of the LICC, a general rule

does not revoke a prior special rule. However, in this case, only the

character of specialty is not sufficient to decide for the application of the

aforementioned Decree. Once again, analysis is required in light of the

teleological/purposive scope of the legal system as a whole.

Therefore, in light of the principles of supremacy of the public

interest and material equality, after the advent of the new Civil

Code, there is no justification for a five-year period for personal actions filed against the

Treasury, which establishes a longer period for the public entity, exceeding

that provided in procedural relations between private parties, of three years, since

there have been no changes in our Democratic State of Law that would make us

imagine that the prerogatives for public entities in court have ceased. The

axiological vectors underlying our legal order remain the same, that is,

the guiding principles of legislative, administrative, or

judicial activity have not been inverted.

With this, we do not want to completely exclude the application of

art. 1 of Decree No. 20,910/32, art. 2 of Decree-Law No. 4,597/42, and art.

1-C of Law 9,494/97. They are perfectly adequate for cases where the

period for private parties is equal to or greater than 5 (five) years. When this does not

occur, it should be understood that the three-year limitations period provided in art. 206,

§ 3, V, of the Civil Code also applies to actions to be filed against the

Treasury.

Indeed, this is what the special rule itself provides, when

in article 10 it states:

Decree 20,910/30, Art. 10 - The provisions of the preceding articles do not

alter shorter limitations periods, contained in laws and

regulations, which are subject to the same rules.

For this reason, recognition of the

statute of limitations for any and all rights claimed by the plaintiff prior

to the three-year period or, subsidiarily, to the five-year period preceding the filing of this

action is requested. On this aspect, the case should be dismissed, with resolution on the merits.

IN THE ALTERNATIVE - ON THE PRELIMINARY ISSUE OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE

UNDERLYING RIGHT

In the event of non-acceptance of the partial two-year

statute of limitations, there is no doubt, Eminent Judge, that the claim at issue is covered by the mantle of the statute of limitations. Article 1 of Decree-Law No. 20,910,

of January 6, 1932, provides, in verbis:

Art. 1. The passive debts of the Federal Government, the States, the Municipalities,

as well as any and all rights or actions against the federal,

state, or municipal Treasury, whatever their nature,

prescribe in 5 (five) years, counted from the date of the act or fact from

which they originated.

Ratifying and better defining, federal Decree-Law

No. 4,597, of August 19, 1942, determines in its art. 2 that "Decree No.

20,910, of January 6, 1932, which regulates the five-year statute of limitations, covers

the passive debts of autonomous agencies, or parastatal entities and agencies, created

by law and maintained through taxes, fees, or any contributions required

by virtue of federal, state, or municipal law, as well as any and all

rights to action against them." (emphasis added)

In this sense, the following decisions from national

Courts:

When it is a recognized right, about which there is no question, there

the installments go prescribing, but if the right to

installments derives from the right to annulment of the act, it is clear that, once the

action in relation to it has prescribed, it is not possible to judge only the

installments prescribed, because the action for recognition of the right,

from which the right to installments would derive, has prescribed. Otherwise, it would be admitting the

effect without the cause. Precedents. (RE 73,958, DJU 09.11.81, p. 8794)

SPECIAL APPEAL - STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE UNDERLYING RIGHT - ACCRUED

INSTALLMENTS.

-The underlying right prescribes when, by action or omission, the State

fails to establish the legal situation that gives rise to the benefit for the

employee. The right to receive accrued installments prescribes,

prior to five years, counted from the lawsuit, once the

legal situation has been established, the relationship being one of successive installments. (SPECIAL

APPEAL No. 34,156-9/SP, DJU 02.21.94, p. 2187)

SPECIAL APPEAL. FIVE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. FEDERAL DECREE

No. 20,910/32.

Not only the installments prescribe, but the underlying right itself

if the administration, by explicit or implicit act, denies the

claimed right and the action is not filed within the limitations period. Special

appeal heard and granted. (Sp. App. 2,506-0/SP 2nd Panel STJ,

DJU of 02/21/94). (Emphasis added).

ADMINISTRATIVE. ACTION AGAINST CLASSIFICATION.

FIVE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. APPEAL DENIED.

The action of a statutory employee seeking correction of classification

prescribes in five years. Idle, for almost two decades, against the act

of classification, the plaintiff can no longer question it, after the

lapse of such a long period, since the hypothesis is one of presumption of the

underlying right itself. Appeal denied. [TRF of the 1st Region. Civ.

App. No. 91.01.05051-6/DF. DJU of 10/4/93, p. 41259.]

In this case, the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit only

in 2018, that is, more than 15 (fifteen years) after the facts, leaving

no doubt, therefore, that the claim is time-barred.

In view of the above, the defendant requests, as a preliminary matter, that Your

Honor recognize the occurrence of the statute of limitations on the plaintiff's claim.

Private Nascimento was not present at the instructions mentioned. In fact, in his place was Private Albert Einstein.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Accordingly, the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT requests Your

Honor to recognize the occurrence of the statute of limitations; or the judgment

of total dismissal of the claims made in the complaint, with the plaintiff

being ordered to pay court costs and attorney's fees,

at the maximum legal rate;

In these terms, respectfully submitted.
