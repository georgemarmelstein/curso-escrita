TO THE HONORABLE FEDERAL JUDGE OF THE _______ COURT OF THE JUDICIAL SECTION OF FORTALEZA - CEARA

"For the tortured, in torture, only the exit remains - unimaginably difficult - of silence. Through it, one guarantees and affirms, in heroic degree, one's integrity as a person, through the realization of a supreme value. The torturer, this one has no exit, none. When successful - and this is his best hypothesis -, the torturer, like the hyena, begins to feed on a corpse." (Helio Pellegrino, in The Stupidity of the Demon).

"They tortured me so much that I fainted, Elisa. When I opened my eyes, I was no longer on the pau-de-arara, I was lying on a stretcher, in another room (...) I thought: I must not be dying (...) But the worst, Elisa, came later ..." (Roberto Drumond, Coca-Cola Blood, a work with excerpts inspired by the experience of Jose Adao Pinto, collected by the novelist)

FRANCISCO DA SILVA, Brazilian, married, military, ID No. 00000000 SSP/CE, and Taxpayer ID 000.000.000-00, residing at ADDRESS 1, ZIP 60.511-480 in Fortaleza-CE, comes, respectfully, before Your Honor, through his attorneys, to file an ORDINARY ACTION FOR MORAL DAMAGES against the Federal Government, headquartered in this Capital, at Rua Vilebaldo Aguiar, 96, Ed. Duets Office Towers - North Tower, 9th, 11th and 12th floors - Coco - Fortaleza - CE - Zip 60192-010, in the person of its legal representative, for the factual and legal grounds set forth below:

STATEMENT OF FACTS

FRANCISCO DA SILVA, in March 2003, enlisted in mandatory military service in the 10th Military Region, as a soldier. With exactly 1 month of service, in April 2003, the plaintiff was participating in Day and Night Compass Orientation Training held at Fortaleza Air Base, which was made available for Army training.

During this training, the Plaintiff suffered severe assaults by Lieutenant Pedro, Corporal Arlindo, and Private Nascimento, as shown in the (attached documents) of the investigation opened at the time, conducted by the 23rd Hunter Battalion, Order 24/Sect of April 2003.

The Plaintiff was assaulted by the aforementioned with kicks to the arms, multiple stomps on the head, causing various injuries that he continues to live with to this day, in addition to receiving several death threats from Lieutenant Pedro.

Witnesses to the assaults suffered include Leandro (witness 1), Carlos (witness 2), and Leonardo (witness 3), all soldiers from the 10th Military Region who served together with the Plaintiff.

In May 2003, he suffered new torture attacks, both physical and psychological, during training conducted in the jungle, receiving multiple club blows to the left knee, throat, and head, being forced to drink hot mud and lie on it, causing him even more injuries including ear, throat, and knee problems, having to take various medications and undergo endless treatments, as the treatments only alleviate his pain, but unfortunately, Your Honor, there is no cure and he will have to live with these afflictions until his death due to the abuses he suffered in the army while serving.

It should be noted that after these assaults, the Plaintiff was hospitalized due to the attacks and the physical state they left him in, for at least 10 (TEN) days, but after this other beating, he preferred to remain silent to avoid a new investigation and to prevent the incident from repeating itself on other occasions and trainings, causing him great panic and fear.

The Plaintiff was discharged from the Army on 11/28/2003, but as previously stated, he continues to suffer from the traumas and injuries from the incidents, having various health problems, such as respiratory problems, swelling of face and eyes at various times of the day, secretions from the ears along with other hearing problems, and is undergoing psychological and psychiatric treatment at CAPS, performs various tests through the public health system, and through tests was diagnosed with Chronic Laryngitis (LPRD - Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease).

Since his arrival in the Brazilian army, he suffered discriminatory and racist conduct, as if living under an authoritarian regime, was subjected to violent physical and psychological torture, without any reason, at least unknown to the Plaintiff, as he always had excellent behavior during his service period as shown by the attached good conduct certificates. The winds of democracy that blew in this Country from 1988 onwards rekindled hope of justice for torture victims before its advent, and to accept this type of conduct today is to assassinate our Federal Constitution. And as it is known as the Mother Constitution, it brings with it the possibility of compensation for material and moral damages suffered during the previous regime and for all who continue to suffer from it in current times (OUTRAGEOUS).

This is the reason why the Plaintiff comes to the Judiciary through this action. The torturers are protected. However, amnesty does not affect, nor could it, the just right to compensation. In fact, the Law is undoubtedly favorable to the Plaintiff's claim: the facts have a solid evidentiary basis, the damage is clear, as is the strict liability of the Federal Government. It is now necessary to establish all these elements.

LEGAL GROUNDS

As is known, civil liability arises from the conjunction of three elements: damage, causal connection, and fault. In the case of state liability, when the conduct is commissive, proof of fault is unnecessary, requiring only the existence of a causal relationship between the conduct of the public agent and the damage. In the present case, the moral damage emerges from the facts themselves.

The Plaintiff was subjected to inquisitorial-type procedure. Being subjected to various types of physical and psychological torture while serving the Brazilian army. Without regular process, without trial, without judicial oversight. At the same time, in the facilities of the 10th Military Region, during his entire period of military service, he lived in constant fear of suffering everything he had already suffered, plus the fear of dying from death threats he received inside due to the investigation opened after the first beating he had received.

After this phase, he was discharged from the Army on 11/28/2003. As consequences of this terrible period, he was left with various health problems, such as respiratory problems, swelling of face and eyes at various times of the day, secretions from the ears along with other hearing problems, and is undergoing psychological and psychiatric treatment at CAPS, performs various tests through the public health system, and through tests was diagnosed with Chronic Laryngitis (LPRD - Laryngopharyngeal Reflux Disease), all resulting from the aforementioned facts, where these torturers beat, kicked, forced to drink mud, choked, and clubbed the Plaintiff. Also on the list of damages, it should be remembered the dismantling of his personal life, including from a professional and material point of view. Discharged at the end of 2003, today in 2018, he still has not been able to rebuild his life, as he lives daily treating his physical and psychological afflictions, with long waiting lines and bureaucracy of the public health system and CAPS, to alleviate his pains and injuries obtained during his time of service in the Brazilian army, which did not care for his physical and mental integrity and turned a blind eye to this type of occurrence.

The facts and damages in the "Brazil: Never Again" research.

The reported facts, which in themselves and in their effects constitute moral damage. Here, in summary, are the moral damages: psychological torture, physical torture and its injuries abundantly described above, the physical consequences of this period, especially chronic laryngitis and constant swelling in the face and eyes, and also all the psychological suffering, resulting from the trauma experienced and the fact of having his life destroyed, all the prejudice suffered, his personal identity semi-destroyed. As for psychological suffering, see the case law (presumption of truth of damage): "Simply moral damage, without repercussion on the patrimony, cannot be proven. It exists solely by the offense, and from it is presumed, being enough to justify compensation." (TJPR - 4th C. - Ap. Rel. Wilson Reback - j. 12.12.90 - RT 681/163). Regarding the causal relationship and the responsibility of the Federal Government: Like the damages, the causal connection naturally flows from the narrative of facts. Evidently, if the Plaintiff suffered torture and mistreatment in the facilities of a federal institution, it is up to the Federal Government to compensate him for the damages suffered. Also because his tormentors were federal public agents - army soldiers -, in the exercise of the prerogatives of their function. In this case, the Plaintiff suffered all these tortures during training conducted by the Brazilian Army, in Ceara. There, Army soldiers, of various ranks, tortured him, as already described: MILITARY 1, MILITARY 2, and MILITARY 3. Since the harmful conduct was committed by federal public servants, civil liability falls on the Federal Government, in the strict liability modality. The Civil Code, art. 1521, item III, established that the employer, master or principal is responsible for civil reparation, for their employees, servants and agents, in the exercise of the work that is their responsibility, or on the occasion thereof. And according to Supreme Court Precedent 341: "The fault of the employer or principal is presumed for the culpable act of the employee or agent." The Federal Constitution of 1988, on the other hand, enshrined the principle of strict liability in its art. 37, sixth paragraph: "legal entities under public law and those under private law providing public services shall be liable for damages that their agents, in that capacity, cause to third parties, with the right of recourse against the responsible party in cases of intent or fault." And the best doctrine teaches: "Abuse in the exercise of functions, by the servant does not exclude the strict liability of the Administration. Rather, it aggravates it, because such abuse carries the implicit presumption of poor choice of the public agent for the mission that had been assigned to him. (...) Without inquiring whether they come from jus imperii or jus gestionis, since both are forms of administrative action." (Hely Lopes Meireles, Brazilian Administrative Law, 16th ed., Revista dos Tribunais, 1991, p. 551/2). It is inappropriate to file suit against the torturers, because as the same Hely Lopes observes, "the victim's compensation action must be filed solely against the responsible public entity, the servant not being admissible in the lawsuit. The injured party by an act of the Administration has nothing to do with the agent causing the damage, since his right, constitutionally recognized (art. 37, §6), is to be compensated by the legal entity and not by the direct agent of the injury. On the other hand, the guilty servant is not obligated to repair the damage to the victim, since he only answers for his act and for his omission before the Administration he serves, and only in a recourse action can he be civilly liable. (...) The constitutional legislator well separated the responsibilities: the State compensates the victim; the agent compensates the State, through recourse." (idem, p. 555). Moral damages The expression "moral damage" encompasses both the disturbance of a person's feelings and those "spiritual" goods or values (physical integrity, dignity, honor, family, etc.). The Federal Constitution of 1988 lists the essential values of Brazilian society, under the heading "Fundamental Rights and Guarantees." According to the Fundamental Law, art. 5, no one shall be subjected to torture or to inhuman or degrading treatment (item III), freedom of conscience is inviolable (item IV), no one shall be deprived of rights on grounds of political conviction (item VIII), there shall be no special or extraordinary courts (XXXVII), prisoners are assured respect for physical and moral integrity (XLIX), no one shall be deprived of liberty or property without due process of law (LIV), among others. Note that the 1988 Constitution did not bring major innovations. The previous constitution, of 1967, provided for a list of fundamental rights similar to those cited above. Furthermore, since 1948, Brazil has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights which embraces and guarantees these same rights. Other international treaties followed, and Brazil was bound by them. Therefore, even in the legal order prior to 1988, the acts committed against the Plaintiff constituted serious wrongs, giving rise to compensation.

The Plaintiff was humiliated, tortured - physically and psychologically - He lost fifteen years of his life seeking treatment for his injuries through the public health system and CAPS. He endured attacks on his condition as a Black person, being a victim of the cruelest racism.

All without the slightest possibility of a regular process - due process of law. In short, he was injured in fundamental rights such as physical and psychological integrity, freedom of movement, freedom of conscience, the right to adversarial proceedings and full defense. In the psychological aspect, one can calculate the pain felt, the anguish, the fear. In addition, the consequences of the assaults suffered remained, especially chronic laryngitis and swelling in the face, eyes, and secretions from the ears.

Case law has established some criteria for setting the value of compensation for moral damage. The valuation is objective and not arbitrary, and must take into account the peculiarities of each case. Criteria such as the socioeconomic condition of the offender and the injured party, the extent of the damage, the pain experienced by the victim, the degree of intent or fault of the offender, and the importance of the moral and spiritual goods injured have been discussed.

Thus, considering the greatness and essentiality of the injured goods, the existing injuries, the need of the Plaintiff and the capacity of the Defendant (federal political entity), as well as the satisfactory and preventive aspect of compensation, finally, considering all the above criteria and with eyes on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, it is understood that compensation for moral damage should not be less than 10,000 minimum wages, in today's values, R$ 9,540,000.00.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF:

In view of all the above, the Plaintiff requests that this action be received and duly processed, and, in the end, that the claim be granted in totum, with the Defendant being ordered to pay compensation for moral damages suffered by the Plaintiff in an amount not less than 10,000 (ten thousand) minimum wages, taking into account the serious events and their consequences, as described above. The Plaintiff further requests: a) The GRANTING of the benefits of free legal assistance, as provided in art. 5, LXXIV, of the Constitution, in Law No. 1,060/50 and in article 98 of the Code of Civil Procedure, since the plaintiff is poor, in the legal sense of the term, not having the means to bear the costs arising from the lawsuit, without prejudice to his own and his family's livelihood; b) The SERVICE OF PROCESS on the defendant in the person of its legal representative, to appear before this August Court of Justice, at a public hearing on a day and time to be designated and, if desired, within the legal period, to answer the present action, under penalty of the facts reported here being deemed true, pursuant to art. 246, items I and V of CPC/2015, under penalty of confession and default; c) Recognition of the state's strict liability in the case now described; d) The scheduling of a conciliation hearing, as determined by art. 319, VII, of CPC/2015, with service of process on the DEFENDANT, at the address already mentioned, to answer the terms of this action, if so desired, under penalty of default; e) If the DEFENDANT defaults, may these claims of the action be judged according to the legislation in force and CPC/2015; f) FULL FAVORABLE JUDGMENT of the claim, ordering the defendant with all the legal grounds listed here, to the duty and obligation of unquestionable compensatory act to the PLAINTIFF Or.....still, if it wishes to answer this action, pursuant to art. 344 of CPC., granting this action, to order the defendants to pay compensation for:

TO THE HONORABLE FEDERAL JUDGE OF THE 3RD COURT

FEDERAL OF THE STATE OF CEARA.

Case: No. 0812444-73.2018.4.05.8100

Plaintiff: FRANCISCO DA SILVA

Defendant: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, a legal entity of public law,

represented pursuant to Complementary Law No. 73/93, by this

Attorney's Office in Ceara, comes before Your Honor, through the undersigned

attorney, in the case file referenced above, based on the relevant

procedural legislation, to timely file (service of process on 08/24/2018),

its ANSWER, for the reasons set forth below:

FACTUAL SUMMARY

This is an Ordinary Action for Compensation for Moral

Damages, against the Federal Government (Brazilian Army). The Plaintiff alleges that in March

2003 he enlisted in mandatory military service at the 10th Military Region, as a

soldier, and with exactly 1 month of service, in April 2003, the plaintiff allegedly

suffered severe assaults by Lieutenant Pedro, Corporal Arlindo, and Private Nascimento.

This is a brief summary of the complaint, whose claims do not merit

success, for the reasons set forth below.

ON THE MERITS

Initially, it is appropriate to transcribe the information from

Official Letter No. 088/2018 - Asse Ap Ass Jurd/10 - Brazilian Army 10th

Military Region (MINISTRY OF DEFENSE):

"The military career is not an unspecific and disposable activity, a simple job, an occupation, but an absorbing and exclusive profession, which conditions and self-limits us to the end. It does not require from us the working hours of the law, but all the hours of life, also imposing on us our destinies. The uniform is not a garment, which is removed with ease and even indifference, but another skin, which adheres to the soul itself, irreversibly forever." (Gen Octavio Costa)

These information concern an ordinary proceeding brought by former Variable Effective Soldier (Sd EV) of the Command Company of the 10th Military Region of the Brazilian Army (23rd BC), headquartered in Fortaleza/CE, FRANCISCO DA SILVA, seeking compensation for moral damages on the allegation that he was physically and psychologically assaulted during the period he served in the Army.

The plaintiff does not state, in his complaint, the date he enlisted in the Brazilian Army. He alleges, in brief summary, only that in April 2003, during "compass orientation training" he suffered various physical assaults, which allegedly left consequences, in addition to various threats, which allegedly occurred again on another occasion, in May of the same year, having been hospitalized for 10 days.

He further states that he was discharged from the Brazilian Army on November 28, 2003, and that he continues, since then, to suffer due to the consequences of the traumas suffered, for which he requests compensation for moral damages.

Preliminarily, it is essential to point out the lapse of the statute of limitations in this case. As is known, the Civil Code of 2002, more specifically in item V of paragraph 3 of article 206, establishes that the claim for civil reparation, as in the present case involving compensation for moral damage, is three years. Thus, the plaintiff narrates facts that occurred in 2003 and seeks compensation for them in 2018, 15 years later. There is no doctrinal or jurisprudential discussion about such limitations period, as can be seen in the case law cited below:

The following is the transcript of the requested excerpt:

07. Thus, it should be noted that the Plaintiff's request for compensation for moral damages has no legal support, since there was no illegality or arbitrariness during his Active Service.

08. The Plaintiff requests compensation for moral damages suffered due to alleged practice of illegal acts by the Army, since he has been feeling great psychological distress, revolt, pain, sadness, and apprehension that reveal moral damage.

09. Such allegations should be considered mere sophisms of someone who alleges without even presenting conclusive evidence to prove the psychological damage suffered.

10. It is evident that moral damage has numerous definitions in national doctrine: Pablo Stolze and Rodolfo Pamplona conceptualize it as "injury to rights whose content is not pecuniary, nor commercially reducible to money" (GAGLIANO; PAMPLONA FILHO, 2003, p. 55). Similarly, Maria Helena Diniz establishes moral damage as "the injury to non-patrimonial interests of a natural or legal person, caused by the harmful act." (DINIZ, 2003, p. 84). Scholar Carlos Roberto Goncalves, when conceptualizing moral damage, states that: "Moral damage is that which affects the injured party as a person, not harming his patrimony. It is injury to a good that is part of the rights of personality, such as honor, dignity, intimacy, image, good name, etc., as can be inferred from art. 1, III, and 5, V and X, of the Federal Constitution, and which causes the injured party pain, suffering, sadness, embarrassment and humiliation" (GONCALVES, 2009, p.359)."

13. Claims for moral damages such as the one in this case, completely unfounded and large, discredit and trivialize the institute of moral damage, because they wound it in its credibility, as Ricardo Bechara Santos teaches - in his work "Law in Combat" in Sergio's Column in the "Forensic Law" Notebook - Rio de Janeiro - 1999: "Moral damage, on the other hand, CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT BE ENSHRINED IN A GENEROUS, PHILANTHROPIC, EMOTIONAL THESIS." In reality, the most trivial annoyances of everyday life are today being equated to suffering qualified as unbearable result of strong moral pain. One can almost affirm that any setback, even if commonplace, is for some, labeled as infinite moral damage, aiming only at receiving compensation. Moral damage must be effective and clear, and cannot be considered as such a small setback to which we are all subject in the day-to-day life of large cities.

14. In this sense is the most sought-after case law, extracted from national courts, worthy of transcription given its extreme pertinence to the case under review:

"(...) I have recognized that there is abuse in claims for compensation for moral damage. Unfortunately, they are being distorted, people are wanting to make money at the expense of others, which, moreover, in the economic model in which we live, has become a fashion, and people are transferring this, also, to this area. Absurd situations have already arisen, such as requesting compensation for moral damage for a traffic accident, because the individual was disturbed by the car crash! I would say it is almost without comment, however they are claiming. Life is made of discomforts and disturbances, as I have said, any day compensation will be requested, because someone on the street, looked mean, looked fixedly and the person was shaken, claims compensation for moral damage! (...)" (Justice Sergio Gichkow Pereira, in Motions for Clarification No. 596234443, 3rd Civil Group of TJRS, on 03.07.1997).

15. In this context, proof of the damage suffered is essential, whether material or immaterial, for civil liability and consequent obligation to compensate to be established, which does not occur in this case, making any claim for compensation for moral damage allegedly suffered inappropriate.

16. In view of the above, this Advisory Office for Legal Affairs advocates preliminarily for recognition of the statute of limitations, with due dismissal of the action with judgment on the merits, and, on the merits, for total dismissal of the claim, given the lack of any element to support the Plaintiff's claim, judging this to be the pertinent information to support the defense of the Federal Government.

ON THE NON-OCCURRENCE OF MORAL DAMAGES

As seen in the information provided by the 10th MR, there is

no basis for speaking of the occurrence of the facts alleged by the plaintiff. At

no time did the plaintiff prove his allegations.

The plaintiff requests compensation for moral damages suffered due to

alleged illegal acts by Lieutenant Pedro, Corporal Arlindo, and Private Nascimento, alleging that he suffered severe assaults, great

psychological distress, revolt, sadness, and apprehension that reveal moral

damage.

It is evident that moral damage has numerous definitions

in national doctrine: Pablo Stolze and Rodolfo Pamplona conceptualize it as "injury

to rights whose content is not pecuniary, nor commercially reducible to

money" (GAGLIANO; PAMPLONA FILHO, 2003, p. 55). Similarly,

Maria Helena Diniz establishes moral damage as "the injury to non-

patrimonial interests of a natural or legal person, caused by the harmful act." (DINIZ,

2003, p. 84).

Scholar Carlos Roberto Goncalves, when conceptualizing

moral damage states that: "Moral damage is that which affects the injured party as a person,

not harming his patrimony. It is injury to a good that is part of the rights of

personality, such as honor, dignity, intimacy, image, good name,

etc., as can be inferred from art. 1, III, and 5, V and X, of the Federal Constitution, and which

causes the injured party pain, suffering, sadness, embarrassment and humiliation"

(GONCALVES, 2009, p.359)."

Doctrine establishes that a claim for moral damages

must also be based on the triple requirement of harm, the culpable act

of the agent (conduct error marked by imprudence, malpractice, and negligence)

and the causal connection between said act and the harmful result (Civil Code,

art. 186), with the injured party bearing, in principle, the burden of proving the occurrence of

the three aforementioned requirements.

It is notorious that the complaint was not accompanied by

essential documents proving the alleged moral damages

eventually suffered by the plaintiff. On this topic, it is worth bringing to bear the

thinking of HUMBERTO THEODORO JUNIOR, extracted from an article he

published entitled "Civil Liability for Moral Damage," which is

crystallized in the following excerpt:

More than in any other type of compensation, compensation for

moral damage must be imposed from the very foundation of

civil liability, which does not aim to create an unjustified source of profit and advantages without cause. For all the best scholars of the

complicated topic, the updated doctrine of Caio Mario regarding

arbitration of compensation for moral damage applies: And, if in any case

the victim is given compensation for damno vittando, and not for lucro

capiendo, more than ever the concern must be present to

contain the compensation within reason, so that it never becomes

a source of enrichment.

Claims for moral damages without assessing evidence

are completely unfounded and discredit and trivialize the institute

of moral damage, because they wound it in its credibility, as Ricardo

Bechara Santos teaches - in his work "Insurance Law in Daily Life" - Forense Publisher

- Rio de Janeiro - 1999: "Moral damage, on the other hand, CANNOT AND SHOULD NOT

BE ENSHRINED IN A GENEROUS, PHILANTHROPIC, EMOTIONAL THESIS."

In reality, the most trivial annoyances of everyday life

are today being equated to suffering qualified as unbearable

result of strong moral pain. One can almost affirm that any

setback, even if commonplace, is for some, labeled as infinite moral

damage, aiming only at receiving compensation. Moral damage must

be effective and clear, and cannot be considered as such a small

setback to which we are all subject in the day-to-day life of large cities.

In this sense is the most sought-after case law, extracted

from national courts, worthy of transcription given its extreme pertinence to the case

under review:

(...). I have recognized that there is abuse in claims for

compensation for moral damage. Unfortunately, they are being distorted,

people are wanting to make money at the expense of others, which,

moreover, in the economic model in which we live, has become

a fashion, and people are transferring this, also, to this

area. Absurd situations have already arisen, such as requesting compensation for

moral damage for a traffic accident, because the individual was

disturbed by the car crash! I would say it is almost without

comment, however they are claiming. Life is made of

discomforts and disturbances. As I have said, any day compensation will be requested,

because someone on the street, looked mean, looked fixedly and the person

was shaken, claims compensation for moral damage! (...)" (Justice

Sergio Gichkow Pereira, in Motions for Clarification No. 596234443, 3rd

Civil Group of TJRS, on 03.07.1997).

UNNAMED APPEAL. DAMAGES CLAIM. PAYMENT

OF BILLS WITH COINS. LOTTERY OUTLET REFUSAL.

ALLEGATION OF HUMILIATION. MORAL DAMAGE NOT

PROVEN. The plaintiff seeks reversal of the judgment of

dismissal of the action, alleging that he was embarrassed by the

defendant, manager of the Lottery Outlet, who refused to accept

payment of his bills with R$ 200.00 in coins and humiliated him. Although payment of bills with coins is

valid, there is no evidence in the record of an embarrassing situation experienced by

the plaintiff. Furthermore, in the case of a busy lottery outlet,

the time spent counting the coins

would certainly result in harm to serving the other customers.

A situation that with due restraint and good sense could have been

resolved. The evidence produced does not show

embarrassing, humiliating, or offensive conduct faced by the plaintiff to admit compensatory moral

damage. It is emphasized that damage or injury to

personality, deserving of compensation under this title, would only

be established with the exposure of the consumer to a humiliating situation,

as well as offense to an attribute of his honor, image, or any of the

personal rights protected by art. 5, items V and X, of CF/88, which

was not shown to be proven in the case. Witness listed

by the plaintiff whose statements are contradictory to the

factual situation portrayed in the complaint, notably as to the time of

the occurrence, since the complaint states that the fact occurred in February 2015,

while... the declarant states that it was "last week,"

since his testimony occurred in June 2015 (p. 11). APPEAL

DENIED. (Civil Appeal No. 71005809009, Second

Civil Appellate Panel, Appellate Panels, Rapporteur: Roberto Carvalho Fraga,

Judged on 03/01/2016). (TJ-RS - Civil Appeal: 71005809009 RS,

Rapporteur: Roberto Carvalho Fraga, Judgment Date: 03/01/2016,

Second Civil Appellate Panel, Publication Date: Official

Gazette of 03/03/2016).

For all the above, proof of the causal connection

between the actions of the Military Administration and the harm suffered is essential, whether

material or immaterial, as well as how these damages affected the

honor of the plaintiff, for civil liability and

consequent obligation to compensate to be established, which does not occur in this case,

making any claim for compensation for Moral Damage suffered inappropriate.

Now, there is no basis for speaking of moral damage, given the

absence of the basic prerequisite for its establishment: the existence of causal

connection. Moreover, the plaintiff does not even present solid arguments proving that the

Military Administration acted illegally. On this point, PAULO DE

TARSO VIEIRA warns (in Civil Liability in the Consumer Code and the Defense

of the Supplier; Sao Paulo, Saraiva, 2002):

Some facts of life do not go beyond the frontier of mere

annoyances or setbacks. These are the disappointments or

normal disruptions of life in society, which do not allow the

effective identification of the occurrence of moral damage. A traffic

accident, for example, with merely property damages,

constitutes a disruption for those involved, but certainly does not allow the identification, in the vast majority of cases, of the

occurrence of moral damage to any of them.

(...)

The difficulty of doctrine has been to circumscribe, within the limits of

a definition, the common elements pertaining to the immense range

of modalities of moral damages, including harm

resulting from aggressions to the right to life, to physical-psychological integrity,

to honor, to freedom, to intimacy, to private life, to

image, both of natural and legal persons.

Exactly due to the diversity of legal goods

susceptible to being affected, moral damages began to be classified

as subjective and objective. Subjective moral damage is that

which affects the sphere of psychological intimacy, having as effect the

feelings of pain, anguish, and suffering for the injured person.

In contrast, objective moral damage is that which affects the

moral dimension of the person in his social sphere, causing

harm to the image of the injured party in the social environment, although

it may also cause pain and suffering.

(...).

Simple disruptions and annoyances of social life, although

unpleasant, do not have sufficient relevance, by themselves, to

constitute moral damage. One must evaluate, in the concrete case,

the extent of the fact and its consequences for the person, so that

one can verify the effective occurrence of moral damage. (...)."

In light of the principle of reasonableness and the principle of

proportionality, no compensable moral damage is established in

this case. Sergio Cavalieri Filho, in turn, teaches with great clarity:

In the difficult question of knowing what constitutes moral damage,

the judge must follow the trail of reasonable logic, in search of

normal ethical-social sensitivity. He must take as paradigm the

citizen who is equally distant from the cold, insensitive man

and the man of extreme sensitivity. Along this principle,

only pain, embarrassment, suffering

or humiliation should be considered as moral damage which, departing from normality, intensely interferes

with the psychological behavior of the individual, causing him affliction,

anguish, and imbalance in his well-being, mere

disappointment, annoyance, resentment, irritation, or exacerbated sensitivity not being sufficient." (Civil Liability Program, Ed. Atlas,

2007).

The plaintiff did not experience any type of embarrassment,

that would cause offense to his personal rights, to warrant application of

article 5, X, of CF/88, especially there was no injury to his image, honor. Moral

damage, verbi gratia, only occurs when there is injury to extra-patrimonial patrimony. At

most, there was a mere annoyance incapable of pecuniary compensation.

On this topic, it is appropriate to transcribe the lesson of Prof. ANTONIO CHAVES:

To advocate for broad compensability of moral damage does not imply

recognition that any and all sensitivity, all exacerbated

susceptibility, all exaltation of self-love, allegedly wounded, the

softest shadow, the slightest brushing of a butterfly's wings,

niceties, scruples, excessive delicacies, insignificant illusions

undone, would allow hundreds of thousands of cruzeiros to be extracted from the Pandora's box of Law

(in Treaty of Civil Law, 3rd ed.,

Sao Paulo, Revista dos Tribunais, 1985, vol. III, p. 637).

For all the above, proof of the causal

connection and its relationship to the harm suffered is essential, whether material or

immaterial, for civil liability and consequent

obligation to compensate to be established, which does not occur in this case, making any

claim for compensation for moral damage suffered inappropriate.

ON THE THREE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS - CIVIL LIABILITY

The plaintiff alleges that the facts underlying his

claim occurred in April 2003, fifteen years ago.

Initially, the statute of limitations should be raised due to

the lapse of the THREE-YEAR PERIOD that preceded the filing of the action, in view of the

advent of the Civil Code of 2002, which caused significant changes in the treatment

of the statute of limitations in favor of the Treasury, as will be demonstrated below.

In fact, with the publication of Law No. 10,406/2002, which

instituted the new Civil Code, substantial changes were felt in the part

relating to the statute of limitations, especially with the discipline of art. 206, § 3, item V,

which established a three-year limitations period for "civil reparation claims."

In this context, it should be noted that the issuance of Decree

No. 20,910/32, establishing the prerogative for the Treasury of a

five-year limitations period, was justified, at the time it arose in the Brazilian

legal system, by the principle of supremacy of the public interest and material equality.

Through such principles, it can be inferred that the prerogatives conferred

on public law entities exist for the purpose of enabling the fulfillment of the

administrative function by the State. Therefore, the special deadlines granted to the

Treasury do not constitute unjustified favoritism or privileges,

since they were granted with the aim of providing the public entity with efficient instruments for the exercise of its activities, consequently, for the promotion

of the interest of all the collectivity.

Thus, the granting of prerogatives

by the ordinary legislator is justified, among which the limitations one, with respect to the

Federal Government. Then, let us see:

The Civil Code of 1916, in its article 117, provided for a

limitations period of 20 (twenty) years for personal actions, 10 (ten) years for

real actions between present parties and 15 (fifteen) between absent ones. Given this reality,

Decree No. 20,910/32 was issued, providing for a five-year limitations period for

actions filed against the Treasury, in clear compliance with the

principles cited above. Subsequently, with the issuance of Decree-Law No.

4,597/42 and, finally, of Law No. 9,494/97, with the wording given by Provisional

Measure No. 2,180-35/2001, the granting of such prerogative regarding the

statute of limitations was ratified.

Once the legislator's interest in granting

a differentiated situation to public entities when in court has been demonstrated, we move

to the second consideration, namely, the institution of the new Civil Code of

2002 and the need for a dialogical interpretation of its provisions and,

here, the one that interests us - the limitations period.

Thus, it is understood that if Law No. 10,406/02

provides, in its article 206, § 3, V, already cited, that the limitations period is THREE

years in personal actions involving only natural or

legal persons of a private nature, nothing more reasonable than that the same period be

extended to the Treasury when it is the defendant in the

lawsuit, since the continued application of the five-year period contained in

Decree 20,910/32 constitutes a true breach of principles that permeate

our legal system.

Obviously, it is known that most current doctrine and

case law understand that the specialty character of Decree

20,910/32 prevails over the Civil Code of 2002, considering this a

general rule and that, thus, according to article 3, § 2 of the LICC, a general rule

does not revoke a prior special rule. However, in this case, only the

character of specialty is not sufficient to decide for the application of the

aforementioned Decree. Once again, analysis is required in light of the

teleological/purposive scope of the legal system as a whole.

Therefore, in light of the principles of supremacy of the public

interest and material equality, after the advent of the new Civil

Code, there is no justification for a five-year period for personal actions filed against the

Treasury, which establishes a longer period for the public entity, exceeding

that provided in procedural relations between private parties, of three years, since

there have been no changes in our Democratic State of Law that would make us

imagine that the prerogatives for public entities in court have ceased. The

axiological vectors underlying our legal order remain the same, that is,

the guiding principles of legislative, administrative, or

judicial activity have not been inverted.

With this, we do not want to completely exclude the application of

art. 1 of Decree No. 20,910/32, art. 2 of Decree-Law No. 4,597/42, and art.

1-C of Law 9,494/97. They are perfectly adequate for cases where the

period for private parties is equal to or greater than 5 (five) years. When this does not

occur, it should be understood that the three-year limitations period provided in art. 206,

§ 3, V, of the Civil Code also applies to actions to be filed against the

Treasury.

Indeed, this is what the special rule itself provides, when

in article 10 it states:

Decree 20,910/30, Art. 10 - The provisions of the preceding articles do not

alter shorter limitations periods, contained in laws and

regulations, which are subject to the same rules.

For this reason, recognition of the

statute of limitations for any and all rights claimed by the plaintiff prior

to the three-year period or, subsidiarily, to the five-year period preceding the filing of this

action is requested. On this aspect, the case should be dismissed, with resolution on the merits.

IN THE ALTERNATIVE - ON THE PRELIMINARY ISSUE OF STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE

UNDERLYING RIGHT

In the event of non-acceptance of the partial two-year

statute of limitations, there is no doubt, Eminent Judge, that the claim at issue is covered by the mantle of the statute of limitations. Article 1 of Decree-Law No. 20,910,

of January 6, 1932, provides, in verbis:

Art. 1. The passive debts of the Federal Government, the States, the Municipalities,

as well as any and all rights or actions against the federal,

state, or municipal Treasury, whatever their nature,

prescribe in 5 (five) years, counted from the date of the act or fact from

which they originated.

Ratifying and better defining, federal Decree-Law

No. 4,597, of August 19, 1942, determines in its art. 2 that "Decree No.

20,910, of January 6, 1932, which regulates the five-year statute of limitations, covers

the passive debts of autonomous agencies, or parastatal entities and agencies, created

by law and maintained through taxes, fees, or any contributions required

by virtue of federal, state, or municipal law, as well as any and all

rights to action against them." (emphasis added)

In this sense, the following decisions from national

Courts:

When it is a recognized right, about which there is no question, there

the installments go prescribing, but if the right to

installments derives from the right to annulment of the act, it is clear that, once the

action in relation to it has prescribed, it is not possible to judge only the

installments prescribed, because the action for recognition of the right,

from which the right to installments would derive, has prescribed. Otherwise, it would be admitting the

effect without the cause. Precedents. (RE 73,958, DJU 09.11.81, p. 8794)

SPECIAL APPEAL - STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON THE UNDERLYING RIGHT - ACCRUED

INSTALLMENTS.

-The underlying right prescribes when, by action or omission, the State

fails to establish the legal situation that gives rise to the benefit for the

employee. The right to receive accrued installments prescribes,

prior to five years, counted from the lawsuit, once the

legal situation has been established, the relationship being one of successive installments. (SPECIAL

APPEAL No. 34,156-9/SP, DJU 02.21.94, p. 2187)

SPECIAL APPEAL. FIVE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. FEDERAL DECREE

No. 20,910/32.

Not only the installments prescribe, but the underlying right itself

if the administration, by explicit or implicit act, denies the

claimed right and the action is not filed within the limitations period. Special

appeal heard and granted. (Sp. App. 2,506-0/SP 2nd Panel STJ,

DJU of 02/21/94). (Emphasis added).

ADMINISTRATIVE. ACTION AGAINST CLASSIFICATION.

FIVE-YEAR STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. APPEAL DENIED.

The action of a statutory employee seeking correction of classification

prescribes in five years. Idle, for almost two decades, against the act

of classification, the plaintiff can no longer question it, after the

lapse of such a long period, since the hypothesis is one of presumption of the

underlying right itself. Appeal denied. [TRF of the 1st Region. Civ.

App. No. 91.01.05051-6/DF. DJU of 10/4/93, p. 41259.]

In this case, the plaintiffs filed this lawsuit only

in 2018, that is, more than 15 (fifteen years) after the facts, leaving

no doubt, therefore, that the claim is time-barred.

In view of the above, the defendant requests, as a preliminary matter, that Your

Honor recognize the occurrence of the statute of limitations on the plaintiff's claim.

Private Nascimento was not present at the instructions mentioned. In fact, in his place was Private Albert Einstein.

PRAYER FOR RELIEF

Accordingly, the FEDERAL GOVERNMENT requests Your

Honor to recognize the occurrence of the statute of limitations; or the judgment

of total dismissal of the claims made in the complaint, with the plaintiff

being ordered to pay court costs and attorney's fees,

at the maximum legal rate;

In these terms, respectfully submitted.

Fortaleza/CE, September 18, 2018.

ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE UNION


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
REPLY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

TO THE HONORABLE FEDERAL JUDGE OF THE 3RD

FEDERAL COURT OF THE STATE OF CEARA.

Case: No. 0812444-73.2018.4.05.8100

Plaintiff: FRANCISCO DA SILVA

Defendant: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

FRANCISCO DA SILVA, duly

qualified in the case file referenced above, comes, with due

respect and superior deference before Your Honor, through his

undersigned attorneys, to REPLY to the ill-conceived answer of the

defendant, doing so as follows:

INITIALLY THE PLAINTIFF STATES THAT THE DEFENDANT DID NOT

CHALLENGE ANY OF THE EVIDENTIARY DOCUMENTS PRESENTED

WITH THE COMPLAINT, THEREFORE, HAVING THEM AS

ABSOLUTELY [VALID], WHICH IN ITSELF LEADS TO THE GRANTING OF

THE ACTION.

As a Preliminary matter, the defendant raises the three-year

civil liability period, stating that the plaintiff is not entitled even to the

five-year period, requesting dismissal of the case with resolution on

the merits. The defendant affirms the interest of the supremacy of public interest over

private interest. But, Your Honor, in the concrete case this involves a military member and not a

civilian, and according to the understanding of the Superior Court of Justice we have

that crimes of torture during the military dictatorship era are imprescriptible,

and may be judged at any time, when in fact this request is

extremely absurd, for the reasons set forth below:

Compensation for torture during military regime may be requested at

any time (Source: www.stj.jus.br)

1/6

"Actions for compensation for damages derived from acts of torture

that occurred during the Military Regime are imprescriptible. The

Second Panel of the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) reiterated the

understanding already consolidated that, in cases seeking

the defense of fundamental rights, compensation for moral damages

resulting from acts of torture for political reasons or of any

other kind, the five-year statute of limitations

(quinquennial) should not prevail."

So let us see, by analogy to curtail the rights of the Plaintiff who is military and

who was under military authority and as the defendant herself stated it is not

a mere job or service but a responsibility to the nation and the

Brazilian people.

"The military career is not an unspecific and disposable activity, a

simple job, an occupation, but an absorbing and

exclusive profession, which conditions and self-limits us to the end. It does not

require from us the hours of the law, but all the hours of life, also imposing

on us our destinies. The uniform is not a garment, which is removed

with ease and even indifference, but another skin, which adheres

to the soul itself, irreversibly forever." (Gen. Octavio

Costa).

The plaintiff as already stated in the complaint suffered several assaults and torture

both physical and psychological during training conducted in the jungle, receiving

multiple club blows to the left knee, throat, and head, being forced to

drink hot mud and lie on it, causing him even more injuries

with ear, throat, and knee problems, having to take various

medications and undergo endless treatments, these abuses suffered

in the Brazilian army caused severe schizophrenia, so much so that the Plaintiff is

interdicted by the court, with his wife as his guardian, that is, the statute of limitations

alleged by the Federal Government is not applicable, because even if the

analogy of torture for crimes during the military regime of imprescriptibility were not granted, there would be

suspension of the limitations period since he did not have sufficient conditions

to file this action and another thing: as shown in the (docs.

attached) there was an administrative disciplinary proceeding (ADP), showing the plaintiff's

interest against all the assaults and torture suffered while serving the

Brazilian Army.

2/6

The case is easy to understand. Just observe the contents of the

complaint, there being indeed, as proven therein, that the plaintiff was duly

tortured and that obstructing his fundamental rights is to agree with the

inhumane treatment and to attest so that other cases

related within the Brazilian army occur again, encouraging impunity so that

these contradictory actions to what our homeland preaches repeat.

ON MORAL DAMAGES

Today, a large part of society is outraged by crimes

committed against law-abiding citizens, corruption, and the neglect of

authorities due to outdated law or an inefficient system to make

those responsible for their illegal and criminal acts comply, one can no longer

accept, especially within an institution of homeland defense, that such

absurdities occur against a person who was in the service of our country.

As is known, civil liability arises from the conjunction of three

elements: the damage, the causal connection, and fault. In the case of state

liability, when the conduct is commissive, proof of fault is unnecessary,

requiring only the existence of a causal relationship between the conduct of the public

agent and the damage.

In the present case, moral damage emerges from the facts themselves. The Plaintiff was

subjected to inquisitorial-type procedure. Being subjected to various

types of physical and psychological torture while serving the Brazilian army. Without

a regular process, without trial, without judicial oversight.

At the same time, in the facilities of the 10th Military Region, during his

entire period of military service, he lived in constant fear of suffering everything he

had already suffered, plus the fear of dying from the death threats he received

inside due to the investigation opened after the first beating he had received.

The expression "moral damage" encompasses both the disturbance of the feelings of

a person, as well as those "spiritual" goods or values (physical integrity,

dignity, honor, family, etc.).

The Federal Constitution of 1988 lists the essential values of Brazilian

society, under the heading "Fundamental Rights and Guarantees." According to the

3/6

Fundamental Law, art. 5, no one shall be subjected to torture or to

inhuman or degrading treatment (item III), freedom of conscience is inviolable (item

IV), no one shall be deprived of rights on grounds of political conviction (item VIII),

there shall be no special or extraordinary courts (XXXVII), prisoners are assured

respect for physical and moral integrity (XLIX), no one shall be deprived of liberty

or property without due process of law (LIV), among others. Note that the

1988 Constitution did not bring major innovations. The previous constitution, of

1967, provided for a list of fundamental rights similar to those cited above.

Furthermore, since 1948, Brazil has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human

Rights which embraces and guarantees these same rights. Other

international treaties followed, and Brazil was bound by them. Therefore, even in the

legal order prior to 1988, the acts committed against the Plaintiff constituted

serious wrongs, giving rise to compensation.

The Plaintiff was humiliated, tortured - physically and psychologically - Lost

fifteen years of his life seeking treatment for his injuries through

the public health system and CAPS. He endured attacks on his condition as a Black person, being a victim

of the cruelest racism. All without the slightest possibility of a regular

process - due process of law. In short, he was injured in fundamental rights

such as physical and psychological integrity, freedom of movement, freedom of

conscience, the right to adversarial proceedings and full defense. In the psychological aspect,

one can calculate the pain felt, the anguish, the fear. In addition, the

consequences of the assaults suffered remained, especially chronic laryngitis and swelling

in the face, eyes, and secretions from the ears.

Case law has established some criteria for setting the value of

compensation for moral damage. The valuation is objective and not arbitrary, and must

take into account the peculiarities of each case. Criteria such

as the socioeconomic condition of the offender and the injured party, the extent of the damage,

the pain experienced by the victim, the degree of intent or fault of the offender, and the

importance of the moral and spiritual goods injured have been discussed.

THE PLAINTIFF THEREFORE REQUESTS THAT YOUR HONOR NOT ACCEPT THE

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS CLAIM MADE BY THE DEFENDANT, MAINTAINING THE

CONTINUATION OF THE ACTION.

4/6

On the MERITS arguments, the defendants allege, weakly, the

Non-existence of Causal Connection between the alleged damage and any action or

omission by the defendant, CONFESSING THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS UNABLE

TO PROVE ANYTHING ALLEGED.

Now Your Honor, the causal connection is abundantly proven, as an

ADP (Administrative Disciplinary Proceeding) was opened on this case, the

Plaintiff was hospitalized due to the assaults suffered at the time under

the responsibility of the army, it has already been proven by all the documents

attached that the plaintiff continues to suffer to this day the side

effects of the torture suffered and today takes medication for depression and treatment

for schizophrenia caused by all these evils, having no capacity

to manage his life, being interdicted by the court itself and having his wife

as his guardian who suffers together with him in search of justice.

IT IS CONCLUDED, therefore that the contents of the complaint and the

documents attached to it conclude with meridian clarity that the

defendant is not right, as its conduct was outside the limits of

reasonableness. The animus is proven by the negligence, malpractice, and

imprudence practiced by his superiors and the Brazilian army.

THUS YOUR HONOR, IT IS EASILY CONCLUDED THAT THE DEFENDANT

DID NOT ACT CORRECTLY IN PRESENTING THE ANSWER

REPLIED TO ABOVE.

With regard to the basis on which the compensation claim was presented, there

is no doubt about its legality, case law has established some

criteria for setting the value of compensation for moral damage. The valuation is

objective and not arbitrary, and must take into account the peculiarities of each

case. Criteria such as the socioeconomic condition of the

offender and the injured party, the extent of the damage, the pain experienced by the victim, the

degree of intent or fault of the offender, and the importance of the moral and spiritual

goods injured have been discussed.

Thus, considering the greatness and essentiality of the injured goods, the

existing injuries, the need of the Plaintiff and the capacity of the Defendant (federal

political entity), as well as the satisfactory and preventive aspect of compensation,

5/6

finally, considering all the above criteria and with eyes on the Universal

Declaration of Human Rights. The calculations made in the complaint were

presented on a legal basis, all based on judgments by the

Supreme Federal Court, IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE PLAINTIFF,

IN PRESENTING THE INITIAL CLAIM SUGGESTED RESULTS OF

SIMPLE ARITHMETIC CALCULATIONS COMPATIBLE WITH THE CASE UNDER

DISCUSSION, BUT LEFT TO THE FREE DISCRETION OF YOUR HONOR, TO ACCEPT THE

SUGGESTED VALUE OR ARBITRATE ANOTHER VALUE, all in complete

good faith.

Thus RATIFYING the terms set forth in the complaint, the plaintiff requests

the regular continuation of the proceedings, in legal form.

Respectfully submitted

Fortaleza, October 14, 2018.

EXPERT REPORT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXPERT REPORT

1. History of Present Illness:

The examinee appears for the medical examination with a companion and walking without assistance from others and without the aid of devices.

Interview with the plaintiff's wife named Geiza.

During the medical history, the plaintiff's wife informed us that around April 2003 he suffered torture, beatings, and assaults while serving in the army. She reports that around mid-2003 he suffered new attacks of both physical and psychological torture.

After these events, the plaintiff began to present persistent auditory and visual hallucinations, persecutory delusions, and aggressiveness.

At the time, he sought medical assistance and after medical examinations was diagnosed as having schizophrenic disorder. Initially, he received a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (ICD 10 F43.1).

"Extremities: no edema or signs of DVT.

Nutritional status: well-nourished.

Mental Status Examination

The examinee presented for the medical examination with unkempt appearance; disheveled hair. He was uncooperative. Conscious, disoriented in time, space, and auto-psychically. Hypervigilant and normotense. No alteration of self-consciousness. Memory impaired. Thought with abnormal and disorganized course, content, and form. Presence of delusions and auditory hallucinations. Depressed mood. Judgment and insight impaired. Intelligence not assessed. Inadequate pragmatism.

Neurological Examination:

Normal gait. Muscle strength preserved in upper and lower limbs. Muscle tone preserved. Negative Romberg, motor coordination within normal limits for age. Reflexes preserved and symmetric."

The text appears to be an excerpt from a medical discussion about post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to traumatic/stressful events at work.

It mentions that the plaintiff presented diagnostic criteria compatible with PTSD, but which can be defined as "occupational post-traumatic stress disorder" or "work-related post-traumatic stress disorder."

There are two central characteristics: 1) exposure to an event involving threat of death or serious injury to oneself or others, and 2) the development of highly specific symptoms related to this traumatic event, such as response and persistent re-experiencing of autonomic hyperarousal symptoms.

To define an event as traumatic according to the DSM-V, it must satisfy two parts of criterion "A": 1) the person experienced, witnessed, or was confronted with one or more events involving threat of death or serious physical injury, or threat to the physical integrity of oneself or others; 2) the person reacted with intense fear, helplessness, or horror.

Currently in persistent treatment with a condition that has evolved to psychotic disorder (see medication) and occasional re-experiencing of traumatic events in stimulating situations. In some cases, the conditions persist for a prolonged period, even if adequate treatments are initiated, and may be considered temporary, but in these cases the author suggests that it be considered permanent work disability.

The image presents an excerpt from a document discussing the concept of work disability. According to the text, work disability should be understood as the impossibility of performing work duties due to medical, physical, or mental changes, arising from various situations. The concept of disability encompasses issues such as aggravation of the illness, risks to the life of the employee or third parties, and what continuation of work may entail.

Work disability is different from the impossibility of performance due to specific changes in an activity or profession, and the concept of disability comprises an analysis of the following parameters: degree, duration, and scope of the task performed.
