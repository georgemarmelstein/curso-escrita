TORTURE CASE - REPLY
================================================================================

TO THE HONORABLE FEDERAL JUDGE OF THE 3RD

FEDERAL COURT OF THE STATE OF CEARA.

Case: No. 0812444-73.2018.4.05.8100

Plaintiff: FRANCISCO DA SILVA

Defendant: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

FRANCISCO DA SILVA, duly

qualified in the case file referenced above, comes, with due

respect and superior deference before Your Honor, through his

undersigned attorneys, to REPLY to the ill-conceived answer of the

defendant, doing so as follows:

INITIALLY THE PLAINTIFF STATES THAT THE DEFENDANT DID NOT

CHALLENGE ANY OF THE EVIDENTIARY DOCUMENTS PRESENTED

WITH THE COMPLAINT, THEREFORE, HAVING THEM AS

ABSOLUTELY [VALID], WHICH IN ITSELF LEADS TO THE GRANTING OF

THE ACTION.

As a Preliminary matter, the defendant raises the three-year

civil liability period, stating that the plaintiff is not entitled even to the

five-year period, requesting dismissal of the case with resolution on

the merits. The defendant affirms the interest of the supremacy of public interest over

private interest. But, Your Honor, in the concrete case this involves a military member and not a

civilian, and according to the understanding of the Superior Court of Justice we have

that crimes of torture during the military dictatorship era are imprescriptible,

and may be judged at any time, when in fact this request is

extremely absurd, for the reasons set forth below:

Compensation for torture during military regime may be requested at

any time (Source: www.stj.jus.br)

1/6

"Actions for compensation for damages derived from acts of torture

that occurred during the Military Regime are imprescriptible. The

Second Panel of the Superior Court of Justice (STJ) reiterated the

understanding already consolidated that, in cases seeking

the defense of fundamental rights, compensation for moral damages

resulting from acts of torture for political reasons or of any

other kind, the five-year statute of limitations

(quinquennial) should not prevail."

So let us see, by analogy to curtail the rights of the Plaintiff who is military and

who was under military authority and as the defendant herself stated it is not

a mere job or service but a responsibility to the nation and the

Brazilian people.

"The military career is not an unspecific and disposable activity, a

simple job, an occupation, but an absorbing and

exclusive profession, which conditions and self-limits us to the end. It does not

require from us the hours of the law, but all the hours of life, also imposing

on us our destinies. The uniform is not a garment, which is removed

with ease and even indifference, but another skin, which adheres

to the soul itself, irreversibly forever." (Gen. Octavio

Costa).

The plaintiff as already stated in the complaint suffered several assaults and torture

both physical and psychological during training conducted in the jungle, receiving

multiple club blows to the left knee, throat, and head, being forced to

drink hot mud and lie on it, causing him even more injuries

with ear, throat, and knee problems, having to take various

medications and undergo endless treatments, these abuses suffered

in the Brazilian army caused severe schizophrenia, so much so that the Plaintiff is

interdicted by the court, with his wife as his guardian, that is, the statute of limitations

alleged by the Federal Government is not applicable, because even if the

analogy of torture for crimes during the military regime of imprescriptibility were not granted, there would be

suspension of the limitations period since he did not have sufficient conditions

to file this action and another thing: as shown in the (docs.

attached) there was an administrative disciplinary proceeding (ADP), showing the plaintiff's

interest against all the assaults and torture suffered while serving the

Brazilian Army.

2/6

The case is easy to understand. Just observe the contents of the

complaint, there being indeed, as proven therein, that the plaintiff was duly

tortured and that obstructing his fundamental rights is to agree with the

inhumane treatment and to attest so that other cases

related within the Brazilian army occur again, encouraging impunity so that

these contradictory actions to what our homeland preaches repeat.

ON MORAL DAMAGES

Today, a large part of society is outraged by crimes

committed against law-abiding citizens, corruption, and the neglect of

authorities due to outdated law or an inefficient system to make

those responsible for their illegal and criminal acts comply, one can no longer

accept, especially within an institution of homeland defense, that such

absurdities occur against a person who was in the service of our country.

As is known, civil liability arises from the conjunction of three

elements: the damage, the causal connection, and fault. In the case of state

liability, when the conduct is commissive, proof of fault is unnecessary,

requiring only the existence of a causal relationship between the conduct of the public

agent and the damage.

In the present case, moral damage emerges from the facts themselves. The Plaintiff was

subjected to inquisitorial-type procedure. Being subjected to various

types of physical and psychological torture while serving the Brazilian army. Without

a regular process, without trial, without judicial oversight.

At the same time, in the facilities of the 10th Military Region, during his

entire period of military service, he lived in constant fear of suffering everything he

had already suffered, plus the fear of dying from the death threats he received

inside due to the investigation opened after the first beating he had received.

The expression "moral damage" encompasses both the disturbance of the feelings of

a person, as well as those "spiritual" goods or values (physical integrity,

dignity, honor, family, etc.).

The Federal Constitution of 1988 lists the essential values of Brazilian

society, under the heading "Fundamental Rights and Guarantees." According to the

3/6

Fundamental Law, art. 5, no one shall be subjected to torture or to

inhuman or degrading treatment (item III), freedom of conscience is inviolable (item

IV), no one shall be deprived of rights on grounds of political conviction (item VIII),

there shall be no special or extraordinary courts (XXXVII), prisoners are assured

respect for physical and moral integrity (XLIX), no one shall be deprived of liberty

or property without due process of law (LIV), among others. Note that the

1988 Constitution did not bring major innovations. The previous constitution, of

1967, provided for a list of fundamental rights similar to those cited above.

Furthermore, since 1948, Brazil has been a signatory to the Universal Declaration of Human

Rights which embraces and guarantees these same rights. Other

international treaties followed, and Brazil was bound by them. Therefore, even in the

legal order prior to 1988, the acts committed against the Plaintiff constituted

serious wrongs, giving rise to compensation.

The Plaintiff was humiliated, tortured - physically and psychologically - Lost

fifteen years of his life seeking treatment for his injuries through

the public health system and CAPS. He endured attacks on his condition as a Black person, being a victim

of the cruelest racism. All without the slightest possibility of a regular

process - due process of law. In short, he was injured in fundamental rights

such as physical and psychological integrity, freedom of movement, freedom of

conscience, the right to adversarial proceedings and full defense. In the psychological aspect,

one can calculate the pain felt, the anguish, the fear. In addition, the

consequences of the assaults suffered remained, especially chronic laryngitis and swelling

in the face, eyes, and secretions from the ears.

Case law has established some criteria for setting the value of

compensation for moral damage. The valuation is objective and not arbitrary, and must

take into account the peculiarities of each case. Criteria such

as the socioeconomic condition of the offender and the injured party, the extent of the damage,

the pain experienced by the victim, the degree of intent or fault of the offender, and the

importance of the moral and spiritual goods injured have been discussed.

THE PLAINTIFF THEREFORE REQUESTS THAT YOUR HONOR NOT ACCEPT THE

STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS CLAIM MADE BY THE DEFENDANT, MAINTAINING THE

CONTINUATION OF THE ACTION.

4/6

On the MERITS arguments, the defendants allege, weakly, the

Non-existence of Causal Connection between the alleged damage and any action or

omission by the defendant, CONFESSING THAT THE PLAINTIFF WAS UNABLE

TO PROVE ANYTHING ALLEGED.

Now Your Honor, the causal connection is abundantly proven, as an

ADP (Administrative Disciplinary Proceeding) was opened on this case, the

Plaintiff was hospitalized due to the assaults suffered at the time under

the responsibility of the army, it has already been proven by all the documents

attached that the plaintiff continues to suffer to this day the side

effects of the torture suffered and today takes medication for depression and treatment

for schizophrenia caused by all these evils, having no capacity

to manage his life, being interdicted by the court itself and having his wife

as his guardian who suffers together with him in search of justice.

IT IS CONCLUDED, therefore that the contents of the complaint and the

documents attached to it conclude with meridian clarity that the

defendant is not right, as its conduct was outside the limits of

reasonableness. The animus is proven by the negligence, malpractice, and

imprudence practiced by his superiors and the Brazilian army.

THUS YOUR HONOR, IT IS EASILY CONCLUDED THAT THE DEFENDANT

DID NOT ACT CORRECTLY IN PRESENTING THE ANSWER

REPLIED TO ABOVE.

With regard to the basis on which the compensation claim was presented, there

is no doubt about its legality, case law has established some

criteria for setting the value of compensation for moral damage. The valuation is

objective and not arbitrary, and must take into account the peculiarities of each

case. Criteria such as the socioeconomic condition of the

offender and the injured party, the extent of the damage, the pain experienced by the victim, the

degree of intent or fault of the offender, and the importance of the moral and spiritual

goods injured have been discussed.

Thus, considering the greatness and essentiality of the injured goods, the

existing injuries, the need of the Plaintiff and the capacity of the Defendant (federal

political entity), as well as the satisfactory and preventive aspect of compensation,

5/6

finally, considering all the above criteria and with eyes on the Universal

Declaration of Human Rights. The calculations made in the complaint were

presented on a legal basis, all based on judgments by the

Supreme Federal Court, IT SHOULD BE EMPHASIZED THAT THE PLAINTIFF,

IN PRESENTING THE INITIAL CLAIM SUGGESTED RESULTS OF

SIMPLE ARITHMETIC CALCULATIONS COMPATIBLE WITH THE CASE UNDER

DISCUSSION, BUT LEFT TO THE FREE DISCRETION OF YOUR HONOR, TO ACCEPT THE

SUGGESTED VALUE OR ARBITRATE ANOTHER VALUE, all in complete

good faith.

Thus RATIFYING the terms set forth in the complaint, the plaintiff requests

the regular continuation of the proceedings, in legal form.

Respectfully submitted

Fortaleza, October 14, 2018.
