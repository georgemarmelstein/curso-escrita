Case No. 0009999-00.2016.8.26.0535

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 1ST CRIMINAL COURT OF GUARULHOS-SP

It appears from the enclosed police investigation records that, on 10/02/2016, at approximately 04:25 a.m., on Rua das Flores, Jardim Marilena, in this city and judicial district of Guarulhos/SP, RODRIGO SILVA LIMA (under 21 years old), identified at page 50, and IGOR SANTOS COSTA (under 21 years old), identified at page 54, acting in concert and with common purpose with two other unidentified individuals, did steal for common benefit, through serious threat with the use of a firearm, the vehicle VW/Gol, license plate ABC-1234, as per the report at page 15, and a cell phone, belonging to the victim J.

STATE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE OF SAO PAULO
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE OF GUARULHOS
Case No. 0009999-00.2016.8.26.0535

According to the investigation, the defendants and two other unidentified individuals conspired to commit vehicle robbery.

To this end, on Rua das Flores, they approached victim J., who was driving his VW/Gol vehicle on the public road.

Through serious threat with the use of a firearm, they demanded the delivery of the vehicle and cell phone. In possession of the goods, they left the scene, taking them.

Subsequently, on Rua Sao Paulo, while driving the VW/Gol vehicle, Rodrigo and Igor approached victim F. and demanded that he surrender his vehicle.

However, upon realizing that F. was a military police officer, Rodrigo fired a gunshot, and F., being armed, reacted and began exchanging gunfire with the robbers, who left the scene without effectively stealing the property.

The shots fired by the defendants were intended to kill victim F. and to secure the theft of his property and impunity for the previously committed robbery.

The theft of victim F.'s vehicle and death were not consummated due to the victim's prompt reaction and the defendants' poor aim, with some shots striking the left front fender of F.'s vehicle.

Therefore, the State Prosecutor's Office charges RODRIGO SILVA LIMA and IGOR SANTOS COSTA under Article 157, Paragraph 2, I and II, and Article 157, Paragraph 3, second part, combined with Article 14, item II, pursuant to Article 69, all of the Penal Code, and requests that the indictment be accepted, that the defendant be summoned to file a response, with subsequent scheduling of a hearing for trial, so that, in the end, he may be convicted, all in accordance with the procedure provided in Article 394, Paragraph 1, I, of the Code of Criminal Procedure (ordinary common procedure).

Date: October 03, 2016

Defendants: RODRIGO SILVA LIMA and IGOR SANTOS COSTA

The Judge opened the hearing and the defendants were brought in under escort.

After hearing the parties, the Judge rendered the following:

DECISION

Considering the nature of the crimes charged (robbery with use of firearm and attempted murder), the manner in which the acts were committed, demonstrating social dangerousness, and the existence of probable cause shown by the victim's photographic recognition of the defendants, I CONVERT the in flagrante delicto arrest into PREVENTIVE DETENTION, pursuant to Articles 310, II, and 312 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The preventive detention is necessary to guarantee public order, as the defendants, if released, could commit new offenses, and to ensure the application of criminal law, preventing them from fleeing.

The request for provisional release is DENIED.

Issue the incarceration order.

Notify the parties.

ATTORNEY AT LAW

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 1ST CRIMINAL COURT OF GUARULHOS, STATE OF SAO PAULO

Case No.: 0009999-00.2016.8.26.0535

IGOR SANTOS COSTA, already duly identified in the records of the CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS brought against him by the STATE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, through his undersigned attorney, respectfully comes before YOUR HONOR to present this

MOTION FOR REVOCATION OF PREVENTIVE DETENTION
AND
REQUEST FOR PROVISIONAL RELEASE

pursuant to Article 310, sole paragraph, and Article 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, for the following reasons of fact and law:

I - SUMMARY OF THE FACTS:

The Petitioner was arrested in alleged flagrante delicto on 10/02/2016, and by decision of the custody hearing, his arrest was converted into preventive detention.

The Petitioner states that he is INNOCENT of the charges against him, as he was not at the location of the robberies at the time of the facts. On the contrary, he was the VICTIM of an attack, having been shot in the leg while returning home from a party on his motorcycle.

The Petitioner was traveling on his motorcycle with his brother (Natanael Raul Silva Martins) who was riding on the back of his friend's (Daniel Oliveira Alves) motorcycle in front of him, and another friend on another motorcycle also in front of him (whom he met at the party), when suddenly a gray car pulled up alongside him, the driver lowered the window and said something. Thinking it was a robbery, the Petitioner accelerated his motorcycle and warned the others. The driver of the car fired four shots, with the fourth shot hitting the Petitioner's leg, causing him to fall.

His brother, upon hearing him scream, asked his friend to turn around on the road to rescue him. When they arrived, they saw the Petitioner on the ground and the shooter nearby. The Petitioner's brother picked him up and carried him to the other side of the street. The shooter got in his car and followed his friend, who managed to lose him. The friend then returned and took the Petitioner to Hospital Sao Luis Gonzaga.

II - LEGAL ARGUMENTS:

A) ABSENCE OF GROUNDS FOR PREVENTIVE DETENTION

There are no grounds for maintaining the preventive detention. The Petitioner:

1. Is a first-time offender with no prior criminal record
2. Has a fixed residence in the judicial district
3. Has lawful employment
4. Has stable family ties

The law provides that preventive detention should only be decreed when strictly necessary for:
- Guaranteeing public order
- Guaranteeing economic order
- Ensuring the application of criminal law
- Ensuring the criminal investigation

None of these circumstances are present in this case.

B) PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE

The constitutional principle of presumption of innocence must be observed. The Petitioner has not been convicted, and there is substantial doubt about his participation in the alleged crimes, as evidenced by the surveillance footage submitted to this Court.

C) PROPORTIONALITY AND ALTERNATIVE MEASURES

Even if the Court considers some precautionary measure necessary, preventive detention is disproportionate. Article 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides for alternative measures that are less restrictive of liberty, such as:

I - periodic appearance in court
II - prohibition of access to certain places
III - prohibition of contact with certain persons
IV - prohibition of leaving the judicial district

D) SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE EVIDENCE

The Petitioner's family obtained surveillance footage from cameras in the areas where the Petitioner was at the time of the incident, which demonstrate:

1st Recording (from Rua das Flores No. 24): Shows the Petitioner, his brother, and friends leaving a party in the Recanto Verde neighborhood in Sao Paulo/Capital at 04:59:12 and each going to their homes, as they all live in the same direction.

2nd Recording (from Av. Sao Paulo No. 13,738), with some minutes of delay relative to the 3rd recording:
- At approximately 05:19:27: Daniel (friend of the Petitioner) and Natanael (brother of the Petitioner) on a motorcycle and a colleague they met at the party on another, hearing what Igor (the Petitioner) was shouting.
- At approximately 05:19:29: Igor (the Petitioner) on his motorcycle, at which time he shouts to his friends and brother that it was a robbery and then gunshots are heard.
- At approximately 05:19:30: the shooter's car, which then fires shots.

3rd Recording (extracted from CAM 16, already previously submitted to the case file):
- At approximately 05:18:19: the Petitioner's friend (Daniel) appears, with the Petitioner's brother on the back of his motorcycle.
- At approximately 05:18:27: the motorcycle mentioned above returns on the road to rescue the Petitioner who is already on the ground, shot in the leg.
- At approximately 05:18:34: a friend they met at the party flees from the shooter.
- At approximately 05:19:03: the Petitioner's brother carries him in his arms to the other side of the road and places him on the sidewalk in front of a school.

III - REQUEST:

In view of the foregoing, considering the constitutional principle of presumption of innocence and the applicability of alternative precautionary measures less severe than preventive detention, the Petitioner requests:

The granting of the revocation of Preventive Detention and the concession of provisional release to the Petitioner, combined with the precautionary measures provided for in item I or III of Article 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the issuance of a RELEASE ORDER to the CDP of Guarulhos, or wherever he is being held, as this is a measure of pure and legitimate

PROSECUTOR'S OPINION

Case No. 0009999-00.2016.8.26.0535 - 1st Criminal Court of Guarulhos

Motion for Revocation of Preventive Detention

Petitioner: Igor Santos Costa

Honorable Judge:

This is a motion for revocation of preventive detention and concession of provisional release, filed by Igor Santos Costa, who argues, through his attorney, that he did not commit the crime, as well as the absence of grounds authorizing the maintenance of preventive custody.

This is the report.

The motion should not be granted.

The claim of non-participation in the crime is a matter of merit and should be discussed at the appropriate time. It should be noted that the submitted media does not prove, on its face, the petitioner's claims, recalling that there is a positive photographic recognition by the victim in the case file.

Furthermore, the requirements for maintaining preventive custody are present. In this case, the custody serves to guarantee the application of criminal law, as well as to prevent the investigation from being hindered by the defendant's escape or intimidation of witnesses and victims.

It is also observed that the crime committed by the petitioner is extremely serious, causing profound social reproach, violating public order.

Therefore, the State Prosecutor's Office manifests for the DENIAL of the motion, maintaining the preventive detention of Igor Santos Costa.

GUARULHOS FORUM
1ST CRIMINAL COURT

DECISION

Case No.: 0009999-00.2016.8.26.0535
Class - Subject: Criminal Action - Ordinary Procedure - Robbery
Plaintiff: State Prosecutor's Office
Defendants: RODRIGO SILVA LIMA and another

Judge: Dr. Maria de Fatima Guimaraes Pimentel de Lima

Having reviewed the case.

This is a reiterated Motion for Revocation of Preventive Detention and concession of Provisional Release filed on behalf of IGOR SANTOS COSTA.

The diligent Defense Attorney argues that this Court, when analyzing the previously submitted motion, **took into account the severity of the crime** and disregarded **"that the defendant is innocent of the charges, does not know the co-defendant and was not even at the location where the events occurred, is a first-time offender, resides in the judicial district, has lawful employment and a fixed residence..."**.

She reports that IGOR was also the victim of a robbery, and that following his arrest for the facts investigated in this case, where he appears as one of the robbery perpetrators, IGOR's mother went to the location where the defendant was shot and obtained some images provided by other residents along the route the defendant traveled that early morning, which show that IGOR was at a location different from the robbery crime scene investigated in these records.

She mentioned some of the circumstances depicted in the images attached to the records, and described "facts" as they were narrated to her by the defendant and his friends.

She further argues that even if the defendant were one of the perpetrators of the crime, his detention cannot stand, since the severity of the crime does not, by itself, authorize the exceptional measure of preventive detention, understanding that in the present case the grounds authorizing preventive custody are not present. Finally, as a subsidiary argument, she requested the application of the precautionary measures listed in Article 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The Prosecutor's Office manifested for the denial of the motion (pages 182/184).

This is the report.

I hereby decide.

Due to the arguments presented by the noble Defense, I note once again that the conduct allegedly committed was extremely serious, and the arguments of atypicality concern the merits and will be analyzed at the appropriate time, under adversarial proceedings.

Furthermore, as cited by the Defense Attorney herself, this Court, when assessing the previously submitted Motion for Revocation of Preventive Detention, already analyzed the records in detail (including the images submitted on that occasion, in which **it was not possible to identify any person or vehicles/motorcycles that appeared therein**, which does not constitute an alibi to remove the defendant from the crime scene), and considering the specific case **decided to deny** the motion and maintain the preventive custody decreed by the Court that presided over the Custody Hearing **(pages 38/40)**, and this Court's conviction remains unchanged.

Indeed, the images contained in the media attached to the present motion **remain precarious and continue to only show motorcycles and other vehicles passing through the mentioned roads, being impossible to identify, for example, the license plates of such vehicles, the models of the motorcycles, their drivers and/or passengers, or even clothing that could in any way demonstrate the Defense's claims brought to date, which I repeat, concern the merits and will be duly assessed.**

Moreover, at this procedural stage, one cannot overlook **the firm recognition made by victim Jose Kaue Leal Amorim - who at the Police Station recognized IGOR by photograph** (both from the Criminal Information Sheet and the one taken at the hospital by the Military Police school team) **as being the individual who searched him, took his cell phone, and drove his vehicle (page 09).**

In view of the above and based also on the decisions at pages 38/40 of the flagrante delicto report and pages 12/17 of the attached Provisional Release Motion (0037394-92.2016.8.26.0224), I **DENY** the motion and maintain the preventive detention of **IGOR SANTOS COSTA.**

I grant the attachment of the media, which shall remain attached to the physical records of the Police Investigation, in the appropriate compartment in the Clerk's Office.

So that it may not be alleged in the future that the Defense was restricted, issue a letter to the Police Authority to carry out the necessary procedures to request the **images captured by cameras installed at property No. 13,748, on Avenida Sao Paulo, (as cited by the Defense at page 154), on October 2, 2016, between 5:00 and 5:30 a.m.** Upon the Police Authority's response, the records shall be brought for immediate review.

Notify the Defense Attorney of this decision, as well as to present the Preliminary Defense on behalf of IGOR, within the legal period.

Notice to the Prosecutor's Office.

MARIA CRISTINA DE SOUZA BACHEL
ATTORNEY AT LAW

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 1ST CRIMINAL COURT OF GUARULHOS, STATE OF SAO PAULO

Case No.: 0009999-00.2016.8.26.0535

IGOR SANTOS COSTA, duly identified in the records of the CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS brought against him by the STATE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE, through his undersigned attorney, respectfully comes before YOUR HONOR to present:

RESPONSE TO THE CHARGES, pursuant to Articles 396 and 396-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in response to the charges filed by the Prosecutor's Office, charging him under Article 157, Paragraph 2, items I and II, and Article 157, Paragraph 3, second part, combined with Article 14, item II, pursuant to Article 69, all of the Penal Code, based on the following facts and legal arguments:

STATEMENT OF FACTS:

The indictment alleges that on 10/02/2016, at approximately 04:25 a.m., on Rua das Flores, Jardim Marilena, in this city and district of Guarulhos/SP, Rodrigo Silva Lima (under 21 years), together with the defendant (under 21 years) and two other unidentified agents, stole, through serious threat with the use of a firearm, the vehicle VW/Gol, license plate ABC-1234, and a cell phone, belonging to victim Jose Oliveira Martins, and on the same day around 05:40 a.m., on Rua Sao Paulo, also in the district of Guarulhos/SP, Rodrigo and Igor attempted to steal a vehicle Fiat/Idea, license plate XYZ-5678, through serious threat with a firearm against victim Felipe Souza Ribeiro, who is a police officer and reacted, and there was an exchange of gunfire, with the robbery not being consummated.

The facts related to defendant **IGOR SANTOS COSTA** are not true, given that the defendant did not participate in the robberies described in the indictment, was not at either location, neither at the first robbery location nor at the location of the second attempted robbery, a truth duly proven by the images and recordings submitted to the records and, at the appropriate time, by the testimony of witnesses who were with the Defendant.

PRELIMINARY MATTERS:

DEFICIENCY OF THE INDICTMENT:

The indictment must be recognized as deficient, given that Article 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure establishes that an essential element of the initial pleading in criminal proceedings is the detailed and individualized description of the criminal act. Non-compliance with this requirement leads to rejection of the indictment, pursuant to Article 395 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

The indictment is deficient because it is indispensable that the indictment describe the act attributed to the defendants; an initial pleading containing a vague, imprecise description, so laconic that it makes impossible or strictly difficult the exercise of full defense and adversarial proceedings, cannot be accepted.

DENIAL OF AUTHORSHIP:

The defendant must be acquitted pursuant to Article 386, item IV, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, given that the defendant did not commit the crimes described in the indictment, having declared his innocence since becoming aware of the facts.

Honorable Judge: As already demonstrated, the submitted images prove that the defendant was not at the location of the facts but was rather a victim at another location, of attempted robbery or attempted murder.

It should be noted that the defendant not only declared his innocence, but his family members sought and continue to seek evidence through recordings and witnesses.

If the defendant were not innocent, he would not be submitting evidence to prove it, nor would he find such evidence, as he has already found.

Furthermore, the burden of proof lies exclusively with the Prosecutor's Office and not with the defendant; however, the defendant has managed to collect evidence to demonstrate his innocence, and therefore should be acquitted of the charges in the indictment.

ON THE LOCATION OF THE FACTS:

The crime scene was not preserved and was not examined, pursuant to Article 6, item I, of the Code of Criminal Procedure, given that this involves a robbery with exchange of gunfire.

ON THE DISTANCES TRAVELED:

According to the police investigation and the testimony of victim Felipe, the exchange of gunfire between him and the criminals who tried to rob him occurred on Rua Sao Paulo, around No. 800, in Guarulhos; however, one of the defendants was admitted to HMU hospital, in the city of Guarulhos, which is located on Rua das Flores, 4.6 km from the location, and defendant Igor was at Hospital Sao Luis Gonzaga, which is located on Rua Rio de Janeiro, Sao Paulo/Capital, 20.8 km from the location of the incident.

It is clear that if the two criminals who were trying to rob victim Felipe were together and were shot, it would be obvious that both would be at the same hospital and consequently the nearest one to the location, and not that one would be taken to the nearest hospital and the other to a distant hospital, after all, both injuries were caused by gunshots and are considered serious.

With respect to the version presented by defendant Igor, he was shot on Rua Sezefredo Fagundes, in Sao Paulo/Capital, and taken to Hospital Sao Luis Gonzaga, also in Sao Paulo/Capital, the distance between them being 9.7 km, that is, the nearest hospital to the incident, proving once again that the facts alleged by the defendant are true and that he did not commit the offenses charged against him.

REQUESTS:

In view of all the foregoing, the Defendant requests Your Honor:

a) The right to present all evidence admissible in law, especially the subsequent attachment of new documents, witness testimony, expert testimony if necessary, in support of the full defense, as well as those already requested in this pleading;

b) That the decision accepting the indictment be declared null and consequently the indictment be rejected;

c) Counter-expert examination of the materials sent to the Crime Laboratory;

d) That the benefits of free legal assistance be granted with respect to the payment of the Court Officer's costs for summoning the witnesses listed in the preliminary defense;

e) The granting of the revocation of Preventive Detention and the concession of provisional release, combined with the precautionary measures provided for in Article 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, with the issuance of a RELEASE ORDER to CDP I of Guarulhos;

f) That the Defendant be SUMMARILY ACQUITTED of the crimes described in the indictment, pursuant to Article 397, item III, of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Respectfully submitted,

Sao Paulo, November 03, 2016.

DECISION

Case No.: 0009999-00.2016.8.26.0535
Class - Subject: Criminal Action - Ordinary Procedure - Robbery
Plaintiff: State Prosecutor's Office
Defendants: RODRIGO SILVA LIMA and another

Judge: Dr. Maria de Fatima Oliveira Silva

Having reviewed the case.

The written responses at pages 189/205 (filed on behalf of Igor) and 220/221 (filed on behalf of Rodrigo) did not demonstrate the non-existence of the conduct described in the indictment, nor any excludable circumstance recognizable at this stage that could lead to acquittal, pursuant to Article 397 of Law No. 11.719/08, making the trial proceedings necessary. I note that at this procedural stage, the principle of "in dubio pro societate" applies, and the collected indicia are sufficient for criminal prosecution. Specifically regarding the written response submitted by Igor's appointed Defense Attorney, I add that the indictment satisfactorily describes the facts, and I observe no defect that could render it invalid or prejudice the right to full defense, it being formally in order. The arguments concern the merits, which will be duly analyzed at the hearing, and any "obscure points" to be clarified may be the subject of inquiries by the Defense to witnesses under adversarial proceedings. The recordings submitted by the Defense Attorney were previously analyzed, on two occasions, by this Judge and do not have the power to change the Court's conviction. For these reasons, the preliminary objection is denied and the acceptance of the indictment is maintained.

I schedule a hearing for examination of witnesses, common and exclusive to the Defense, interrogation of the defendants, presentation of oral closing arguments, and judgment for February 20, 2017, at 3:30 p.m.

Pages 202/203 - I grant the issuance of a letter to COPOM [Police Operations Center], via electronic mail, which should clarify how the Military Police Officers were notified of the occurrence of the facts dealt with in these records and how they became aware of co-defendant Igor's participation in the robbery, and the response should be accompanied by a copy of the PM Police Report, with a period of 15 days fixed for compliance with the procedure. I also grant the requisition of the recordings. Issue a summons to the legal representative of the gas depot located at Rua Principal, 14221, side street of Av. Sezefredo Fagundes, and to the person responsible for the property located at Av. Sezefredo Fagundes, 13748 (house in front of the facts alleged by the defendant), requiring that they provide to the Court Officer copies of the recordings made on the date of the facts (October 2, 2016 - between 4:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. - end of the early morning and beginning of the morning).

Requisition from the Police Authority that within 20 days it provide the forensic report of the first victim's vehicle (VW Gol automobile - license plate ABC-1234), which should be accompanied by photographs and clarify the reason why no forensic examination was requested for said vehicle; as well as forward the forensic report on the other automobile (page 100).

Via electronic mail, if possible, requisition from the Director of Hospital Sao Luis Gonzaga (page 21) to send to this Court within 20 days the medical report of Rodrigo.

Also, via electronic mail, if possible, requisition from the Director of HMU to send to this Court within 20 days the hospital admission form of Igor and the defendant's medical report.

Regarding items "b" and "f" of page 205, they are denied due to the content of this decision.

Item "c" - If shown to be necessary during the proceedings, it should be requested by the Defense, based on the specific case, noting that it should clarify the reason for the procedure and also inform any points it wishes to be clarified in the expert examinations.

Item "d" - Considering that at page 07 of the attached records, there is an employment declaration of Igor as General Helper, demonstrating his financial inability, I grant the benefits of free legal assistance.

Item "e" - I deny the request, with the decision at pages 186/188 remaining unchanged for its own reasons.

Notify or summon the witnesses, as the case may be.

Summon the Expert Erica Silva, listed as a defense witness of co-defendant Igor.

Notify the appointed Defense Attorney of Igor.

Summon the imprisoned defendants.

Attorney MARIA CRISTINA DE SOUZA BACHEL files this "habeas corpus," with a request for preliminary injunction, on behalf of IGOR SANTOS COSTA, alleging that the petitioner is suffering illegal constraint by the Honorable Court of the 1st Criminal Court of Guarulhos, which denied the request for provisional release. She seeks, preliminarily, the revocation of preventive detention. She argues, in summary, the petitioner's innocence, absence of grounds authorizing preventive custody, inadequate reasoning, and violation of the principle of presumption of innocence. She emphasizes that the petitioner is a first-time offender, has good background, has a fixed residence, and lawful employment (pages 01/18).

As can be verified, the petitioner was arrested in flagrante delicto for alleged violation of Article 157, caput, and Article 157, combined with Article 14, item II, all of the Penal Code (page 30).

As the records only contain the attorney's allegations, it is not possible to evaluate the existence of "fumus boni juris" and "periculum in mora." Therefore, as the requirements necessary for the granting of the requested measure are not present, which is an exception in cases of "habeas corpus," I DENY the preliminary injunction, with the matter to be decided by the Judging Panel in its entirety.

Request information with URGENCY, subsequently hearing the Honorable Attorney General's Office.

OF THE STATE OF SAO PAULO

TO THE HONORABLE JUDGE OF THE 1ST CRIMINAL COURT OF GUARULHOS - SP

Case No. 0001804-91.2016.8.26.0224

Control No. 1901/16

RODRIGO SILVA LIMA, already duly identified in the records of the criminal action brought by the State Prosecutor's Office, through the undersigned Public Defender, comes before Your Honor to present a response to the charges, pursuant to Articles 396 and 396-A of the Code of Criminal Procedure, as follows, in accordance with Article 128, item I and following of Supplementary Law No. 80/94.

As there is insufficient evidence of authorship or materiality in the records, lacking, therefore, just cause for the criminal action, the defense requests the rejection of the initial accusation.

If the indictment is not rejected, the defense advocates for the total dismissal of the charges filed by the Prosecutor's Office, which will be proven during the proceedings.

At this time, the defense lists as witnesses the same ones listed by the Prosecutor's Office in the indictment, reserving the right to substitute any of them, if necessary for the adequate defense of the client.

Respectfully submitted,

Guarulhos, November 18, 2016.
