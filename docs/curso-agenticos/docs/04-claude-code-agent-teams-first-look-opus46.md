## Transcricao

[0:00] If you've been following the internet
for the past few days, you've seen that
there's been a lot of hype and a lot of
anticipation for Anthropic's newest
model. So, it's finally here, which is
Opus 4.6. So, today I'm going to just go
through the news. I haven't read this
yet. I'm going to try out Opus 4.6, and
we'll just take a look at it for the
first time.

[0:19] Upgrading to our smartest model. The new Claude Opus 4.6
improves its predecessors coding skills,
plans more carefully, sustains agentic
tasks for longer, can operate more
reliably on larger code bases, and has
better code review and debugging skills
to catch its own mistakes. 4.6 can apply
its improved abilities to a range of
work tasks, financial analysis,
research, creating documents within
co-work. Opus can put all these skills
to work on your behalf.

[0:46] State-of-the-art performance on several evals. Achieves
the highest score on agentic coding
terminal bench 2.0 and leads other
frontier models on humanity's last exam.
Opus 4.6 outperforms the industry next
best model OpenAI GPT 5.2.
Opus 4.6 performs better than any other
model on BrowserCamp.

[1:06] Let's take a look at coding. So agentic coding opus 4.5 was
59.8% and opus 4.6 is reporting 64.5%.
So a pretty substantial improvement.

[4:59] Project Astro is scaffolded. Now, let me install
dependencies and the Cloudflare Tailwind
support, then create the team. Okay, so
it's creating that project.

[5:13] Let me generate the images first since agents will need them. Then
create the team and the tasks. Now it is creating
the tasks for the team. So this is the
new tasks feature. So instead of todos,
we have tasks and tasks can be dependent
on each other and they're very similar
but they're a little bit more advanced.
You can see how it's saying blocked by
number one. So the tasks are dependent
upon each other.

[5:46] Two agents were launched. It's got the
HTML CSS dev, the content writer, and
you can see the tasks are broken out.
It's telling me the content writer is
working on the write the marketing copy
task and the HTML CSS dev is working on
the shared layout component and then
it'll follow up with the other pages here.

[6:10] These are the actual independently running Claude Code
processes. So I can actually go in and I
can tell the HTML CSS dev team member
specifically. I can talk to that member.
This is amazing.
