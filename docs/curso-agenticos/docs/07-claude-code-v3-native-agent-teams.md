## Transcricao (trechos principais)

[0:00] Hello and welcome to this video where
I'm going to be talking about the new
hidden feature within Claude Code which
is the orchestration of Claude Code
sessions. Now these are basically agent
swarms which you may or may not be
familiar with. I believe this is only
available with new Opus 4.6.

[0:20] But the first thing to note is compare with sub
agents because off the bat I was
confused. What's the difference between
this and sub agents? So sub agents is
the one on the left. This one is the one
on the right. The main difference is the
communication and the coordination.

[0:35] Now, to be honest with you, I'm just going to
say something really quickly. I'm not
even convinced that this is a direct
replacement of sub agents because there
is this thing with sub agents where they
work differently.

[4:20] The settings. So if I say well, you'll just
have to believe me. We don't have the
settings set up. So now I'm going to say
please set this up so you can use
agent swarm/teams. So this is a
completely new conversation with Claude
Code, right? So it doesn't have the
previous knowledge that it had. So it
has to reread everything, has to refind
the config file and it has to add it to
the config file.

[4:50] code.claude.com - the documentation.
So there we go. Claude experimental agent teams = 1.
Let me check also if tmux is installed for split pane mode.
Right. So you need to have tmux installed.

[9:06] This is absurd. Like this is just
absolutely crazy. This agent spawn team
thing. Now, it might be more of a
gimmick. We don't know yet. I'm still
testing. We're all still testing. It
seems right now to be useful, of course,
but it does seem to just be an extension
of sub agents in my opinion.

[9:21] The main difference is that they talk to each
other, right? So if there's a problem here, it
will, you know, do whatever. Here we go.
Now I'll mark the task is completed and
notify the team lead. So this is kind of
what was happening with sub agents
anyway. But it is really, really cool
and really, really interesting.

[9:41] Bang, there we go. There's another sub
agent or another team member. Now we
have a homepage builder, a layout
designer. This is pretty cool, guys.

## Pontos-Chave

1. **Agent Swarms**: Orquestracao de multiplas sessoes Claude Code

2. **Sub-agents vs Agent Teams**:
   - Principal diferenca: comunicacao e coordenacao
   - Agent Teams: agentes conversam entre si
   - Sub-agents: reportam ao main

3. **Setup**:
   - Configurar `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`
   - Instalar tmux para split pane mode
   - Documentacao: code.claude.com

4. **Workflow**:
   - Tasks sao completadas e notificam o team lead
   - Teammates especializados (homepage builder, layout designer)

5. **Opiniao do Autor**: Pode ser extensao de sub-agents, ainda em teste
