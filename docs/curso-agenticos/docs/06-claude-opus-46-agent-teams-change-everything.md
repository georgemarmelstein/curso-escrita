## Transcricao (trechos principais)

[0:00] Claude Opus 4.6 just dropped and it changes everything.
And I'm not just talking about prompting anymore.
I'm actually going to orchestrate
entire teams of separate agents
to do a task for me in this video today.

[0:13] Today I'm going to go back to something
I've been trying to build for a while.
I'm going to show you how to build
the ultimate global Tide Times app.
And I'll even pit four agents
against each other to battle it out
to get the best design for my app.

[0:28] Claude Opus 4.6.
And yes, this was announced from Anthropic just the other day.
We're upgrading our smartest model.
It's now Claude Opus 4.6 and improves on
coding skills of course, every time
a new model comes out, it's better.
It's got better at two things in my opinion.

[5:00] What I can see here is it says, wow,
now there's three terminals here.
What have we got?
This is absolutely insane.
Okay, so Claude will be able to read and edit.
Yes I trust this folder.
So now we can actually see if we look over
here, we've got a back end dev up here.
We've got a security and UX review task going on over here.
And we've got a frontend dev that I need
to give permissions to as well.

[5:30] And they're all going to go ahead
now you'll see my front end
version of Cloud Code is actually running
its own two sub agents as well.
At the same time, working on best front
end frameworks for 2026, charting libraries.
So I'm going to get a really good looking app.

[10:07] The image lover would have full bleed ocean photography,
glass morphism columns, and cinematic immersion.
If you want to follow the Apple purist,
it's going to be SF Pro Frosted Glass, true black.

[10:17] Retro 90s monkey - Comic sans visitor counter
wearing Ascii art pure joy and chaos.
So let me know in the comments down below.
Now to those four designs. Which one would you pick?

[10:26] Well, seeing as it tells me
the strongest debate performance came from Gradient King, I'm
going to accept Gradient King this time
and we'll have a look at what it came up with.

[10:34] And here is our new gradient heavy design.
Yes we can see as I hover over things
cards pop out. Everything has a gradient on.
I can actually change this to somewhere
like this in France. And we'll get the tide times.
And everything is looking great here.
It's fully functional, it's gradient heavy.

## Pontos-Chave

1. **Agents Competindo**: 4 agents com propostas de design diferentes batalham entre si

2. **Estrutura Multi-Terminal**:
   - Backend dev
   - Security e UX review
   - Frontend dev
   - Cada um com suas proprias sub-tasks

3. **Frontend com Sub-agents**: O frontend dev roda seus proprios sub-agents para pesquisar frameworks e charting libraries

4. **Debate de Design**:
   - Image Lover: full bleed ocean photography, glass morphism
   - Apple Purist: SF Pro Frosted Glass
   - Retro 90s: Comic sans, ASCII art
   - Gradient King: gradientes em tudo (vencedor)

5. **Resultado**: App funcional com design escolhido pelo debate entre agents
